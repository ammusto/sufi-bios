    "Altruism \n (īthār) is the selfless preference for others advocated in classical Ṣūfism and inspired by the Qurʾān. The French term altruisme , from which the English word derives, is a neologism coined by Auguste Comte (1798–1857) to describe the moral capacity to act selflessly for the benefit of others. It is most closely approximated by the Arabic term īthār , the maṣdar (verbal noun) of the fourth form of the verb athara (“to choose, prefer, or favour someone or something over another”), in the sense of ātharahu ʿalayhi (“he preferred him to another”), in which case it is synonymous with the more common faḍḍala or qaddama ʿalayhi (Ibn Manẓūr, 4:7; al-Zabīdī, 10:20) and, by extension, with akrama (“to accord someone honour”; Ibn Sīda, 10:175). Although discussed in works of philosophical ethics (e.g., Ibn Miskawayh, 22), the connotation of īthār as “selfless preference for others” was inspired by Qurʾān 59:9, in which the Muslims native to Medina (Anṣār) are praised for an act of selfless generosity towards the economically vulnerable Muslim emigrants from Mecca (Muhājirūn) by “preferring them over themselves even though it might lead them into povery” (wa-yuʾthirūna ʿalā anfusihim wa-law kāna bi-him khaṣāṣa) . The exegetes typically gloss āthara here as equivalent in meaning to the verbal noun īthār , in the sense of taqdīm al-ghayr ʿalā l-nafs (“putting another before oneself”; e.g., al-Rāzī, 29:287; al-Qurṭubī, 17:26; al-Bayḍāwī, 2:324), the same meaning usually assigned to it by the lexicographers (Lane, s.v.) and the manner in which it is used in ḥadīth (Wensinck, Concordance , 1:12). In their respective mystical commentaries, the Damascene jurist and philologist al-Sulamī (d. 499/1106) and the Iranian philosopher al-Qushayrī (d. 466/1074) make much the same statement concerning the meaning of the verse (al-Sulamī, Ḥaqāʾiq , 2:218–9; al-Qushayrī, Laṭāʾif , 3:305).",
    "Of particular resonance in Ṣūfism is the fact that both the lexical signification and positive religious valuation of īthār are commonly found in portrayals of exemplary figures associated with the early tradition, especially Abū l-Ḥusayn al-Nūrī (d. 295/907–8), a Ṣūfī of Khurāsānī origin and student of the great Baghdadi mystic al-Junayd (d. 298/911), who is often singled out as a paragon of the altruistic spirit. In a lengthy discourse on īthār in his Kashf al-maḥjūb (Unveiling of the Hidden), for instance, the Ṣūfī apologist al-Hujwīrī (d. c.467/1074) cites al-Nūrī as an exemplar of selfless preference for others for offering to exchange his own life for those of his companions who had been condemned for heresy (236–7), boldly proving that his path ( ṭarīqa ) was indeed founded on the practice of selfless preference for others (ʿAṭṭār, 464). Such examples of altruistic behavior are commonly found throughout the Ṣūfī hagiographical tradition, although they are only irregularly accompanied by explicit references to the term īthār .",
    "More prominent is the association between Khurāsānī Ṣūfīs, such as Abū Ḥafṣ ʿUmar al-Ḥaddād al-Nīsābūrī (d. between 265/879 and 270/884)—who defined īthār as “preferring the lot of one's brethren over one's own, in both this world and the next” (al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , 109)—and explicit references to īthār , something that seems to underscore the particular significance of the concept to the early mystico-religious and communal Malāmatiyya and futuwwa movements. This is obvious from the frequency with which al-Sulamī treats the theme of selfless preference in his works, especially his Kitāb al-futuwwa , a usage that persisted in the mediaeval Persian futuwwat-nāma genre (Sarraf, index, s.v. īthār ).",
    "In contradiction to general descriptions of altruistic behavior in hagiography, analytic discussions of īthār are much rarer, although they can be found to varying degrees in the systematic literature of Ṣūfī handbooks and other didactic and mystical treatises. Citing Abū l-Ḥasan al-Fārisī, the fourth/tenth-century Ṣūfī author al-Kalābādhī classifies selfless preference, or rather the “selfless preference of selfless preference” (īthār al-īthār) , among the ten pillars of Ṣūfism ( Kitāb al-taʿarruf , 89–90), and the famed Ḥanbalite Ṣūfī teacher of Herat ʿAbdallāh-i Anṣārī (d. 481/1089), referring to Qurʾān 59:9, identifies it as the sixty-fifth of the hundred courses traversed by the soul in its journey towards God ( Ṣad maydān , 51). For al-Qushayrī, īthār ranks above the virtues of generosity (sakhāʾ) and liberality( jūd ), in that it is the most perfect form of self-sacrifice and a telling metaphor for love ( Risāla , 1:65, 2:502, 623), the same sense in which it was described earlier by the enigmatic Ṣūfī author Abū Ṭālib al-Makkī (d. 386/996) (2:101–7, passim). Similarly, the outstanding theologian, jurist, original thinker, mystic and religious reformer al-Ghazālī (d. 505/1111) ranks īthār above sakhāʾ in that, unlike the latter, it entails subordinating one's own needs to the needs of others ( Iḥyāʾ , 3:272). In his characteristic style, the renowned Iberian Ṣūfī visionary Ibn ʿArabī (d. 638/1240)—who also discusses the term in the context of jūd —defines īthār both in terms of its outward significance and its inner, ontotheologic, reality ( al-Futūḥāt al-Makiyya , 2:179), whereas the much beloved Persian mystical poet settled at Konya, Rūmī (d. 672/1273), characterises it simply as a potential bulwark against the cupidity (ḥirṣ) of the nafs (self) ( Mathnavī-yi maʿnavī , 320, bk. 2, l. 2563).",
    "Because īthār is an ethical value with explicit social implications, it was natural that discussions of it would expand in length and scope with the rise of ṭarīqa -based Ṣūfism in the sixth/twelfth and seventh/thirteenth centuries. In his celebrated Ṣūfī handbook, the ʿAwārif al-maʿārif (Benefits of Intimate Knowledge), for instance, the Ṣūfī master of Baghdad, Abū Ḥafṣ ʿUmar al-Suhrawardī (d. 632/1234), devotes an entire section to the exposition of the term in the context of Ṣūfī communal and spiritual life (2:74–9), emphasising its social ethic and role in subduing the machinations of the nafs; and in his handbook, which draws heavily upon this work of al-Suhrawardī, ʿIzz al-Dīn al-Kāshānī (d. 735/1334–5) not only systematically classes īthār among the manners and customs (ādāb) of the Ṣūfī cloister but carefully distinguishes among various levels of perfection in its practitioners ( Miṣbāḥ al-hidāya , 161, 172, 241–4).",
    "Variations in emphasis aside, īthār in the general sense of Comte's altruisme has, because of its Qurʾānic association and resonance with the religiously commendable virtues of charity and benevolence, typically been understood in Islam, and especially in Ṣūfism, as a praiseworthy moral and ethical value with express religious and spiritual connotations.",
