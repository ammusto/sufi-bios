    "The decision to devote oneself to celibacy for religious reasons is expressed by tabattala , the fifth form of the verb batala , which means cutting oneself off from all worldly concerns, especially sexual intercourse. This term occurs once in the Qurʾān in (73:8): tabattal ilayhi tabtīlan , “devote yourself completely to Him (God)” by observing total abstinence. Many other Qurʾānic passages testify to the value of this behaviour in the case of certain holy persons. John the Baptist (Yaḥyā) is described as having been endowed by God with “a tenderness coming from Us and an absolute purity (zakāt)” (Q 19:12). This term, referred to in the context of the chastity of the Virgin Mary, refers implicitly to the Questions of Bartholomew , an apocryphal book (second to fourth century CE), which says, “Peter said to John, ‘You are a virgin and undefiled, and you must ask her [Mary, about Jesus’s birth]’” (2:5). Ephraem the Syrian (d. 373), in his Hymns on the Church (9:18), means the same when he refers admiringly to John as “a Nazirite” (originally, an Israelite consecrated to the service of God). The virginity of Mary also holds an essential place in the Qurʾān (4:156–7; 66:12), and she is called batūl (unmarried, virgin, devoted) in a Sunnī tradition (Ibn Ḥanbal, al-Musnad , 1:461). The same term is applied to Fāṭima, the daughter of the Prophet, but with a different meaning. Al-Biqāʿī (Ibrāhīm b. ʿUmar al-Biqāʿī, Naẓm al-durar fī tanāsub al-āyāt wa-l-ṣuwar , ed. ʿAbd al-Razzāq Ghālib al-Mahdī, 8 vols., Beirut 1995) says, on the meaning of the verse (Q 73:8), “She was called batūl because of her abstention from her fellows, equals, and peers, in her respect for the unicity of God (tawḥīd)— that is, she abstained from associating anything with God.” A Shīʿī tradition confirms this meaning: “A woman came to visit Abū ʿAbdallāh (Jaʿfar al-Ṣādiq). She said, ‘May God bless you, I am a devoted virgin woman.’ He asked her, ‘What is the meaning of the word “devoted,” according to you?’ She replied, ‘Not to be married.’ He asked, ‘For what purpose?’ She replied, ‘In order to receive God’s favour.’ He said, ‘Get away from here! If it is that which attracts the favour of God, then Fāṭima is worthier than you to wear this title, because no woman received more favours than she did’ (al-Kulaynī, Furūʿ al-Kāfī , ed. ʿAlī Akbar al-Ghafārī, 8 vols., Beirut 1985, 5:509).",
    "All the Prophetic traditions, however, prohibited Muslims from practising this type of celibacy, tabattul . Most of these traditions are reported only by Ibn Ḥanbal, but one in particular was unanimously agreed to by the traditionists: “The Prophet forbade ʿUthmān b. Maẓʿūn to do that. If he had allowed him celibacy, we would have been castrating ourselves” (Ibn Ḥanbal, al-Musnad , 1:175, al-Bukhārī, Ṣaḥīḥ , K. al-Nikāḥ , no. 8; Muslim, Ṣaḥīḥ, K. al-Nikāḥ , nos. 6–8). This prohibition is often associated with that of the Christian monastic and eremitic way of life (rahbāniyya) and may also have been a reaction against Manichean doctrines that venerated celibacy, even within marriage. A Prophetic tradition reported by Ibn Ḥanbal ( al-Musnad , 6:125, 157) says, “On the authority of ʿĀʾisha: The messenger of God forbade us celibacy.” Another tradition is reported by Abū Dāwud (Sunan , 11:2045): “On the authority of Maʿqil b. Yasār: A man came to see the Prophet and said, ‘I found a beautiful and high-ranking woman, but she does not give birth to children. Do I have to get married to her?’ He said, ‘No!’ (After his third visit, the Prophet added) ‘Marry affectionate and prolific women so that I can subjugate the other peoples, thanks to them.’” Finally, there is this Shīʿī interpretation of Q 73:8: “ tabattul means complete connection to God and detachment from any other but Him, signified when you point to the sky with your index finger” (Aḥmad b. Fahd al-Ḥillī, ʿUddat al-dāʿī , Qum 1972, 183).",
    "The commentators of the Qurʾān thus interpreted verse 73:8 by neglecting the connotation of sexual abstinence in the verb tabattala , and they took “purification” in only a general sense: “purify your invocation ( du ʿ āʾ ) completely and thus your act of worship (ʿibāda)” (Muqātil b. Sulaymān, Tafsīr , ed. ʿAbdallāh Muḥammad Shiḥāta, 5 vols., Beirut 2002; the same comment appears in the Tafsīr s of al-Ṭabarī and Ibn Kathīr). According to al-Biqāʿī, tabattal means, “Make every effort to cut yourself off from all worldly concerns and to remain pure in everything you do; do it gradually, until this condition becomes your real nature” (Ibrāhīm b. ʿUmar al-Biqāʿī, Naẓm al-durar fī tanāsub al-āyāt wa-l-ṣuwar , ed. ʿAbd al-Razzāq Ghālib al-Mahdī, 8 vols., Beirut 1995).",
    "The jurists emphasised the necessity of marriage, presenting it as an absolute obligation (farḍ) , which nothing but total incapacity permits one to neglect (see al-Shāfiʿī, Kitāb al-umm , 5, Kitāb al-shaʿb, Bāb al-nikāḥ, Bāb mā jāʾa fī amr al-nikāḥ ).",
    "Muslim mystics had a unanimously favourable opinion of marriage, describing it as a necessary trial, a kind of asceticism ordered by God to test the patience of the pious man, and they regarded celibacy as a harmful obstacle to those setting out on the Ṣūfī way.",
