    ", Various approximate translations of this word can be given, as will appear. The meanings that predominate are “reality”, in the sense of the intelligible nucleus of the thing existing, or “nature” of the thing, or “transcendental truth” of that which exists. The term is not Ḳurʾānic, unlike ḥaḳḳ (the “real”, the “true”), a divine Name, from which it must be distinguished (see below). As al-Ḏj̲urd̲j̲ānī indicates ( Taʿrīfāt , Leipzig 1845, 94), ḥaḳīḳa derives from ( ḥaḳḳ →) ḥaḳīḳ , which with the addition of the becomes an abstract substantive. — For a more precise understanding of the nuances implied, the vocabularies of grammar, philosophy ( falsafa ) and tasạwwuf must be examined.",
    "1. In rhetoric (and exegesis, tafsīr ), al-ḥaḳīḳa is the basic meaning of a word or an expression, and is distinguished (a) from mad̲j̲āz , metaphor, metaphorical and figurative meaning, and (b) from kayfiyya , in the general sense of analogy. — Ibn Taymiyya has left (ms., coll. Ras̲h̲īd Riḍā, Cairo) a treatise al-Ḥaḳīḳa wa ’l-mad̲j̲āz . When the mad̲j̲āz becomes so habitual in use that it acquires as it were a “basic meaning”, it is then designated al-ḥaḳīḳa al-ʿurfiyya (cf. A. Mehren, Rhetorik , 31, cited by Macdonald, EI \n 1 ). Louis Massignon quotes ( Passion d’al-Ḥallād̲j̲ , Paris 1922, 822) a ms. of al-Ḥallād̲j̲ entitled al-Kayfiyya wa ’l-ḥakīka : kayfiyya is here clearly differentiated from mad̲j̲āz (cf. ibid ., quoting another title al-Kayfiyya wa ’l-mad̲j̲āz , common to both al-Ḥallād̲j̲ and al-As̲h̲ʿarī); ḥaḳīḳa then becomes the “basic, divine and definitive meaning” ( ibid ., n. 2).",
    "2. In falsafa (especially according to Avicennan usage), ḥaḳīḳa possesses a two-fold meaning, the ontological and the logical. (A) Ontological meaning ( ḥaḳīḳat al-s̲h̲ayʾ ): “Everything has a ḥaḳīḳa through which it is what it is... It is what we have called “existence proper” ( al-wud̲j̲ūd al-k̲h̲āṣṣ ); by that, we have not meant to signify concrete ( it̲h̲bātī ) existence... It is clear that each thing has its own ḥaḳīḳa which is its quiddity ( māhiyya )” (Ibn Sīnā, al-S̲h̲ifāʾ , al-Ilāhiyyāt , Cairo ed. 1380/1960, 31; cf. 45). Or again: the ḥaḳīḳa is “the property of being requisite for each thing” ( Nad̲j̲āt , Cairo ed. 1357/1938, 299). There is the same idea in the Is̲h̲ārāt (ed. Forget, Leiden 1892, 139), where it is stated that the ḥaḳīḳa of the triangle depends on causes, one formal and one material, and not on causes efficient and final. — It was in the same Avicennan line that al-Ḏj̲urd̲j̲ānī was to define ḥaḳīḳat al-s̲h̲ayʾ as “the thing as it is in itself” ( Taʿrīfāt , 95). Ḥaḳīḳa must thus be understood not as the thing existing, but as the essence of the thing inasmuch as it exists, the real nature in its absolute intelligibility. The concept that it denotes is in line with the essence, but always in keeping with a connation of “reality”, intra- or extra-mental (cf. S̲h̲ifāʾ , 32). We realise that certain texts identify it with quiddity ( māhiyya ) or essence ( d̲h̲āt ); these should not, however, be regarded as pure synonyms. It appears that the best translation of ḥaḳīḳa must be, according to circumstances, either “nature” or, as Mile. Goichon suggests ( Introduction à Avicenne , Paris 1933, 77), “essential reality”. — A two-fold series of distinctions has to be established: (i) huwiyya , selfness (of the \n ¶ concrete thing); māhiyya , quiddity (essential definition); d̲h̲āt , essence properly speaking; ḥaḳīḳa , “essential reality”; (ii) taḥaḳḳuḳ , verification (of that which is); ḥaḳḳ , Real, transcendingly True; ḥaḳīḳa , reality, or transcendental truth. (B) Logical meaning ( al-ḥaḳīḳa al-ʿaḳliyya ): it is the truth which “the exact conception of the thing” establishes in the intelligence (A.-M. Goichon, Lexique de la langue philosophique d’Ibn Sīnā , Paris 1938, 84). From this same logical point of view, ḥaḳḳ will be the true in the sense of a judgement ( ḥukm ) of equivalence with the real (al-D̲j̲urd̲j̲ānī, op . cit ., 94).",
    "3. In taṣawwuf , the philosophical sense of the term is internalized in a line of deeply relished intellectual experience ( maʿrifa ). The ḥaḳīḳa is the profound reality to which only experience of union with God opens the way, “essential Idea” according to Nicholson ( The idea of personality in \n Ṣūfism , Cambridge 1923, 59); cf. Anṣārī, K. al-Manāzil , the ten. chapters of the section on “realities” ( ḥaḳāʾiḳ ). — There are two attitudes according to the schools, (a) The Ṣūfīs of the “Unity of Witness” ( waḥdat al-s̲h̲uhūd ), e.g. al-Ḥallād̲j̲, reserve for ḥaḳīḳa a sense of the absolute intelligibility of things, understood through the spirit of the mystic, which thus leads to the Real but is not itself the Real. “The [essential] reality ( al-ḥaḳīḳa ) of a thing is on this side of the real ( dūn al-ḥaḳḳ )”, said al-Ḥallād̲j̲ (cf. Louis Massignon, Passion , 568). (b) Later Ṣūfism, from Ibn ʿArabī, was generally to take al-ḥaḳīḳa as the ultimate reality of the real itself in the uniqueness of being of all existence ( waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd ); and the ḥaḳīḳa of the universe is to be God manifested in His attributes (cf. the central thesis of the Fuṣūṣ al-ḥikam of Ibn ʿArabī). Experience of union or identification will therefore be an effective experience (of intellectual-gnostic type) of the unique “reality” beyond the real. — Some Ṣūfi expressions applying this second meaning (al-Ḏj̲urd̲j̲ānī, op . cit ., 95): ḥaḳīḳaṭ al-ḥaḳāʾiḳ , “unique and universal degree of all realities”, also called “presence of union” and “presence of being”; ḥaḳāʾiḳ al-asmāʾ , “realities” of the divine Names, determinations of the Essence ( d̲h̲āt ) and its connexion with the manifested world, — that is to say, the attributes by which men are distinguished from each other; al-ḥaḳīḳa al-muḥammadiyya , the divine Essence in the first of these manifestations, “and it is the supreme Name”.",
    "4. Other usages could be reviewed. Some references may be given, by way of example, to the usage of al-G̲h̲azzālī, who stands so to speak on the hinge between the two vocabularies of falsafa and taṣawwuf (before the full elucidation of the “Uniqueness of Being”). Al-ḥaḳīḳa is the profound reality, the quintessence of things, the flesh that is discovered behind the peel. The expression ḥaḳāʾiḳ al-umūr , “the essential realities of things”, often recurs (e.g. Munḳid̲h̲ , 8), ḥaḳāʾiḳ here being almost synonymous with asrār ; similarly ḥaḳīḳat al-ḥaḳḳ , “the essential reality of the Real” (e.g. Ild̲j̲ām , 56), which in a flash leads faith ( īmān ) to yaḳīn , absolute certainty.",
    "We may further define the meaning of ḥaḳīḳa according to two correlative distinctions ( muḳābal ) which frequently serve to explain it. A. Ḥaḳīḳa as distinct from ḥaḳḳ . The analyses given above form the first step. Ḥaḳīḳa and ḥaḳḳ can be differentiated as the abstract and the concrete: “reality” and “real”, — Deity and God, says L. Massignon ( Passion , 568). Now, “if reality is on this side of the real” (see above), “everything real, affirms al-Ḥallād̲j̲, \n ¶ has its essential reality” ( ibid ., 801, n. i). And again (from al-Sulamī, cf. L. Massignon, Lexique technique de la mystique musulmane , Paris 1954, 310): “The Names of God? From the point of view of our comprehension, they are one single (Name); from the point of view of the Real ( al-ḥaḳḳ = God), they are Reality ( al-ḥaḳīḳa \n )”. Determined by the definite article, al-ḥaḳḳ is the very Name which will most usually denote God in Ṣūfī usage; thus it could not be confused with ḥaḳīḳa . But, without the article, ḥaḳḳ can assume a fully abstract sense which approximates it to ḥaḳīḳa , reality, truth (cf. L. Massignon, ed. of the Kitāb al-Ṭawāsīn , Paris 1913, 184, n. 1). Subsequently (in later Ṣūfism), al-ḥaḳīḳa so coming to denote an effective, deeply felt experience, the man in quest of God will fix his heart upon this by a purification ( tanzīh ) of his idea of the divine attribute (cf. al-Hud̲j̲wīrī, Kas̲h̲f al-maḥd̲j̲ūb , Eng. trans, by Nicholson, Leiden-London 1911, 384). It is in this sense that ḥaḳḳ can denote in God the essence not manifested, and ḥaḳīḳa the divine attributes which are indeed the inmost being of things, their essential reality (cf. Dict , of techn . terms , 333 ff.). The Ṣūfīs of the “unity of Being” like to call themselves “the People of the ḥaḳīḳa ”; but “the People of the Sunna and the Community” claim the title of ahl al-ḥaḳḳ , (cf. H. Laoust, La profession de foi d’ Ibn Baṭṭa , Damascus 1958, 166, n. 2).",
    "This is one of the themes of the Kas̲h̲f al-maḥd̲j̲ūb of al-Hud̲j̲wīrī. Ḥaḳīḳa here receives a meaning very near to G̲h̲azālī’s usage. It is the profound reality which remains immutable “from the time of Adam to the end of the world”, like the knowledge of God, or religious practice, which only the inner purpose renders perfect. S̲h̲arīʿa (“Law”) is the reality which can undergo abrogations or changes like ordinances and commandments. Two errors are to be guarded against: that of the pure jurists who refuse to distinguish between inner reality and the regulations of the Law, and that of the bāṭiniyya and extremist S̲h̲īʿīs (eg. Ḳarmaṭīs), teaching that the Law is abolished when profound Reality is attained. In fact, says al-Hud̲j̲wīrī, the s̲h̲arīʿa cannot possibly be maintained without the existence of the ḥaḳīḳa , nor can the latter without observance of the s̲h̲arīʿa ( Kas̲h̲f al-maḥd̲j̲ūb , Eng. tr., 383). Each of them rests on three pillars: for ḥaḳīḳa , it is the three-fold knowledge (a) of the Essence and Unity of God, (b) of His Attributes, (c) of His Actions and His Wisdom; for s̲h̲arīʿa , the three-fold knowledge (a) of the Ḳurʾān, (b) of the Sunna , (c) of the id̲j̲māʿ ( ibid ., 14). In conclusion, the “mutual relation (of s̲h̲arīʿa and ḥaḳīḳa ) may be compared to that of body and spirit” ( ibid ., 383).",
    "Thus ḥaḳīḳa , in the sense either of profound or essential reality, or of transcendental truth, was to be currently used in very different lexicons (the Ḥanbalī al-Barbahārī, Ṭabaḳāt , ii, 22, was to speak of “the reality of the faith”, ḥaḳīḳat al-īmān , which only the observance of the whole body of religious prescriptions guarantees; cf. H. Laoust, op . cit ., 82, n. 1). Falsafa was to make it a precise term of ontology and logic; and taṣawwuf employed it very differently, depending on whether the inner experience specified was or was not situated within a monist view of the relations of God and the world."
