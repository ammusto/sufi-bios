    "( a. ), pole.",
    "1. As an astronomical term",
    "In Arabic, ḳuṭb covers nearly the same field of semantic aspects as Greek ὁ πόλος: a pivot around which something revolves (in Arabic, especially the pivot for mill stones), which was extended to the revolution of the sky, designating the axis of the celestial east-west movement and, more specifically, its two “poles” ( LA , Beirut 1955, i, 681b f.; Lane, Lexicon , s.v. ḳuṭb ; Liddell and Scott, Greek-English lexicon , s.v. πόλος). Hence later, in Arabic translations of Greek works, ḳuṭb was often used as a rendering of πόλος c, (e.g. Ptolemy, Almagest , i, 3 (both translations, al-Ḥad̲j̲d̲j̲ād̲j̲ b. Yūsuf b. Maṭar, and Isḥāḳ b. Ḥunayn); but Aristotle, De caelo , has al- falak in all instances, cf. Badawī’s edn., Cairo 1961, 232 f., 280, 294).",
    "The celestial pole was a known feature among the Arabs already in their “pre-scientific” period, i.e. before their contact with the scientific literature of the Greeks. Certain traditions concerning the location and nature of the pole have been transmitted in some philological and astronomical books (Ibn Ḳutayba, K. al- Anwāʾ , Hyderabad 1956, 122 f.; Abū Ḥanīfa al-Dīnawarī, apud al-Marzūḳī, K. al-Azmina wa ’l-amkina , Hyderabad 1332, ii, 7 f., 371 ff.; Ibn al-Ad̲j̲dābī, al-Azmina wa ’ l- anwāʾ , Damascus 1964, 65 f.; Ibn Manẓūr, K. Nit̲h̲ār al- azhār , Istanbul 1298, 146, 173; Abu ’l-Ḥusayn al-Ṣūfī, K. Ṣuwar al- kawākib , Hyderabad 1954, 27 f. (repeated by al-Ḳazwīnī, Kosmographie , ed. Wüstenfeld, i, Göttingen 1849, 29; tr. H. Ethé, El- Kazwīnī’ s Kosmographie \n , Leipzig 1868, 62); al-Bīrūnī, K. al- Tafhīm , ed. and tr. R. R. Wright, London 1934, 77 [§163]; idem, al- Ḳānūn al- Masʿūdī , Hyderabad, iii (1956), 995 f.). Here it is stated that the [north] pole was not a star, but merely a spot ( muḳṭa , buḳʿa ) in the sky. Its place was assumed to be in the middle of the figure of a fish ( samaka ; al-Bīrūnī has instead: s̲h̲akl halīlad̲j̲ī , “an elliptical figure”) formed by two curved lines of stars, one consisting of the five stars β, ζ, ε, δ, α Ursae Minoris, and the opposite one of very small and faint stars (most of them not registered by Ptolemy in his Almagest ), among which Fl. 5 and 4 Ursae Minoris and 32 H Camelopardalis. In some places, this statement is corrected, with the addition that the true place of the pole is not in the very middle of that figure, but more in the direction of α Ursae Minoris, near one of the small stars in the curved line of faint stars, (al-Marzūḳī, Ibn al-Ad̲j̲dābī, al-Ṣūfī, locc . cit .). This difference in location obviously reflects the effect \n ¶ of precession, due to which the place of the north pole was near the star 32 H Camelopardalis in A.D. 1000, and still more southwards in A.D. 500. It was also observed that the opposite point of the sky, the south pole, was invisible in the lands of the Arabs (Ibn Ḳutayba, loc . cit ., 122; Ibn Manẓūr, op . cit ., 173)",
    "After the introduction of scientific astronomy, it was known that this pole belonged to the equatorial system, hence it was occasionally called ḳuṭb muʿaddil al- nahār , “pole of the equator”, besides its other designations, such as simply al- ḳuṭb , or al-ḳuṭb al- s̲h̲amālī (and al- d̲j̲anūbī respectively), ḳuṭb al- d̲j̲udayy , ḳuṭb banāt naʿs̲h̲ , ḳuṭb al-falak , ḳuṭb al-kull , etc. Al-Bīrūnī seems to be the first to declare a Ursae Minoris (= “Polaris”) to be the nearest bright star to the [north] pole, at his time, and hence to serve as a substitute for the pole wa- yanūbu ʿani ’l-ḳuṭbi \n li-annahū fī zamāninā aḳrabu ’l-nayyirati ilayhi \n ( Tafhīm , 77 [§ 163]). At the same time, the ecliptical system was assigned two poles, as well, which were called ḳuṭb [ ā ] falak al- burūd̲j̲ and ḳuṭb [ a ] dāʾirat al-burūd̲j̲ \n , “pole[s] of the ecliptic” (al-Ṣūfī, loc . cit ., 25 f.; al-Bīrūnī, Tafhīm , 55 f. [§ 139]; idem, Ḳānūn , iii, 993, 995 ff.; al-Ḳazwīnī, op . cit ., 27, tr. 59, and 52 f., tr. 108).",
    "North and south pole became of actual value for the Islamic navigators of the Indian Ocean ( ca . A.D. 1500), who used both of them for altitude measurements in order to fix their position and determine their routes. In their terminology the north pole was generally called al- d̲j̲āh (a word of Persian origin, used both for the pole itself and for the Pole Star). Travelling south of the equator, they also acquired a complete knowledge of the south pole, ḳuṭb suhayl (“the pole [in the region] of the star α Carinae”), or simply al-ḳuṭb (as opposed to al-d̲j̲āh ), which they observed—in contradistinction to the north pole— not to be marked by a bright star near it, but having the two Magellanic Clouds at some distance (Aḥmad b. Mād̲j̲id and Sulaymān al-Mahrī; in English tr. see G. R. Tibbetts, Arab navigation in the Indian Ocean , London 1971, the glossaries and indexes, 518 and 547 [s.v. al-d̲j̲āh ], 538 [s.v. ḳuṭb ], 609 [s.v. Polaris; Pole, North-South]).",
    "The poles also seem to have excited the fantasy of astrologers, for two lists of magic virtues ( k̲h̲awāṣṣ ) appertaining to both of them are repeated by Ibn Manẓūr ( op . cit ., 146-53; partially also in al-Ḳazwīnī, op . cit ., i, 30 f. tr. 64 f. and 40, tr. 83 f.).",
    "In modern terminology, the terrestrial poles are also called ḳuṭb (with adjective ḳuṭbī , “polar”).",
    "Apart from this, in the construction of the astrolabe al-ḳuṭb signifies the central pivot, or axis (elsewhere also called al- miḥwar ), which keeps together its different discs, the spider, and the rule ( Alhidade ), latinised (since the 10th century) as Alchotob , Alchitob , Alchitoth , etc. See asṭurlāb ; al-K̲h̲ w ārazmī, Mafātīḥ al- ʿulūm , 235; al-Battānī, Opus astronomicum , ed.

    "2. In mysticism",
    "In Islamic mysticism, this term (lit. “pole”, “axis”) denotes either the most perfect human being, al- insān al- kāmil [ q.v. ], who heads the saintly hierarchy [see \n al-g̲h̲ayb\n and \n walī\n ] and is also referred to as al-ḳuṭb al- ḥissī (“the [temporal] phenomenal ḳuṭb” ); or else al- ḥaḳīḳa al- muḥammadiyya [see \n ḥaḳīḳa\n ] which manifests itself in al-insān al-kāmil and is sometimes referred to as \n al-ḳuṭb al-maʿnawī \n (“the [cosmic] noumenal ḳuṭb” ). Both meanings of the term are covered by ʿAbd al-Razzāḳ al-Kās̲h̲ānī’s definition: “the place of God’s appearance in the world at all times” (Kamāl al-Dīn Abi ’l-G̲h̲anāʾim ʿAbd al-Razzāḳ b. D̲j̲amāl al-Dīn al-Kās̲h̲ī [al-Kās̲h̲ānī] al-Samarḳandī, Kitāb Iṣṭilāḥāt al- ṣūfiyya , ed. A. Sprenger, London-Calcutta 1845, 141; cf. Muḥyī ’l-Dīn b. al-ʿArabī, al- Futūḥāt al- Makkiyya , Būlāḳ 1274/1857, ii, 6).",
    "The conception of the temporal ḳuṭb (A. ḳuṭb al- waḳt , ṣāḥib al-waḳt \n , ṣāḥib al- zamān \n ; P. mard- i waḳt \n ), referred to by some authors as al- g̲h̲awt̲h̲ (“the helper”) [ q.v. in Suppl.], who exists by virtue of the cosmic ḳuṭb or ḳuṭb al- aḳṭāb , manifest in him, has been traced back to al-Ḥallād̲j̲ [ q.v. ], whose huwa huwa (i.e. the image of God with all his asmāʾ [ q.v. ] and ṣifāt [ q.v. ] in Adam) may be considered as the prototype of the conception of al-insān al-kāmil (cf. A. E. Afifi, The mystical philosophy of \n Muhyid Din Ibnul Arabi , Cambridge 1939, 79, 189), and also further back to pre-Islamic ideas, in particular to Iranian, Neo-Platonic and early Christian thought (see T. Andrae, Die Person Muhammeds in Lehre und glaube seiner gemeinde , Upsala 1917, 333 ff. ; and H. H. Schaeder, Die islamische Lehre vom Vollkommenen Menschen , ihre Herkunft und ihre dichterische Gestaltung , in ZDMG , N.F. iv [1925], 192-268).",
    "The notion of the ḳuṭb as head of the saintly hierarchy is found in the teaching of al-Ḥakīm al-Tirmid̲h̲ī [ q.v. ] outlined by ʿAlī b. ʿUt̲h̲mān al-Hud̲j̲wīrī in his Kas̲h̲f al- maḥd̲j̲ūb (see R. A. Nicholson, tr., The Kas̲h̲f al- Maḥjúb . The oldest Persian treatise on \n Ṣúfism , Leiden-London 1911, 214, 228). The scriptural justification for the belief in this hierarchy, of which the different forms mentioned by a variety of authors are discussed by E. Blochet, Études sur l ’ ésoterisme \n musulman \n , in JA , xx (1902), 77 ff. (in addition, see Ḥasan al-ʿIdwī al-Ḥamzāwī, al- Nafaḥāt al- S̲h̲ād̲h̲iliyya fī S̲h̲arḥ al- Burda al- Būṣīriyya , Cairo n.d. ; Sayyid Ḥaydar Āmulī, in La philosophie Shiʿite , ed. H. Corbin and O. Yahia, Bibl. iranienne 16, Tehran-Paris 1969, 446, and H. Corbin, En Islam iranien . Aspects spirituels et philosophiques , Paris 1971-2, i, 118 ff.), is a ḥadīt̲h̲ attributed to Ibn Masʿūd (cf. Abū Muḥammad ʿAbd Allāh al-Yāfiʿī, Rawḍ al-rayālḥīn fī ḥikāyat al-ṣāliḥīn wa ’l-awliyāʾ wa ’l-akābir , Cairo 1286/1869-70, 10; Yūsuf b. Ismāʿīl al-Nabhānī.

The reliability of the sanad of this ḥadīt̲h̲ was discarded by Muḥammad Ras̲h̲īd Riḍā ( al- Manār , xi [1908], 50 ff.). Other aḥādīt̲h̲ , all without isnād , mentioning the existence of a saintly hierarchy headed by the ḳuṭb , are listed in al-Yāfiʿī’s\n Rawḍ al- rayāḥīn , 10 (see also al-Zamzamī al-Ṣiddīḳ, al- Abdāl \n wa ’l-nud̲j̲abāʾ wa ’l-ak̲h̲yār fī ḥadīt̲h̲ sayyidinā Rasūl \n al- \n Muk̲h̲tār \n , in al-Muslim , ii/6 [Cairo, September 1952], 18 f.), including the most frequently cited one attributed to D̲h̲u ’l-Nūn al-Miṣrī [ q.v. ].",
    "The tentative suggestion by R. A. Nicholson ( The \n \n ¶ \n idea of personality in \n Ṣúfīsm , Cambridge 1923, 44 ff.) I that al- muṭāʿ , mentioned in al-G̲h̲azālī’s\n Mis̲h̲kāt al- anwār , is identical with the ḳuṭb as al- ḥaḳīḳa al- muḥammadiyya was discarded by W. H. T. Gairdner, al- G̲h̲azzālī ’ s Mis̲h̲kāt al-anwār \n ( “The \n niche for \n lights” ). A translation with introduction . London 1924, 23 ff., who had earlier questioned L. Massignon’s suggestion that al- muṭaʿ is an obscure allusion to the doctrine of the ḳuṭb as the head of the saintly hierarchy (idem, al- G̲h̲azālī ’ s Mis̲h̲kāt al-anwār \n \n and the \n G̲h̲azālī \n -problem , in Isl ., v [1914], 144).",
    "Each of the various ranks in the saintly hierarchy has also been conceived of as being headed by a ḳuṭb. \n From these ḳṭāb the saints who belong to these different ranks receive their knowledge, which they owe in the last resort to the supreme (temporal) ḳuṭb (cf. Ibn al-ʿArabī, Futūḥāt , ii, 7; Aḥmad Ḍiyāʾ al-Dīn al-Gümüs̲h̲k̲h̲ānlī. D̲j̲āmiʿ al- uṣūl fi ’ l- awliyāʾ , Cairo 1328/1910, 4; ʿAlī Sālim ʿAmmār, Abu ’ l- Ḥasan al- S̲h̲ād̲h̲ilī , ʿaṣruhu , taʾrīk̲h̲uhu , ʿulūmuhu , taṣawwufuhu , Cairo 1951, i, 192; Aḥmad b. Muḥammad b. ʿAyyād, al- Mafāk̲h̲ir al- ʿaliyya fi ’ l- maʾāt̲h̲ir al- S̲h̲ād̲h̲iliyya . Cairo 1964, 20 ff.).",
    "For Muriyi ’l-Dīn b. al-ʿArabī [ q.v. ], the universal rational principle, the rūḥ Muḥammad , or al-ḥaḳīḳa al-muḥammadiyya through which Divine knowledge is transmitted to all prophets and saints, finds its fullest manifestation in and is identical with the ḳuṭb , who is al- insān al- kāmil . He is the cause of creation, for in him alone creation is fully realised. He is al- barzak̲h̲ [ q.v. ], the ḥaḳīḳat al- ḥaḳāʾiḳ , or in other words he is Muriammad as the inward aspect of Adam, i.e. the real Adam (Mankind) or al- lāhūt [ q.v. ], which is forever manifesting itself on the plane of al- nāsūt [ q.v. ] in prophets and saints (i.e. in aḳṭāb ) who come within the category of al-insān al-kāmil , since they are perfect manifestations of God and have realised, in mystical experience, essential oneness with Him. This makes aḳṭāb infallible, and since there is only one ḳuṭb at a time ( al-ḳuṭb al- wāḥid ), he is God’s real k̲h̲alīfa [ q.v. ], who is the preserver and maintainer of the universe, the mediator between Divine and human, who passes on knowledge of the manāzil (degrees of mystical perfection [see \n manzil\n ]), which cannot be entered by anybody else except by him, through virtue of his being in the manzilat ianzīh al- tawḥīd (absolute transcendence of God) ; cf. Ibn al-ʿArabī, Futūḥāt , i, 168 ff., 201 ff., 253 ff. ; ii, 7 ff., 77, and in particular iv, 80 ff.",
    "These ideas were further elaborated by ʿAbd al-Karīm al-Ḏj̲īlī (cf. Nicholson, Studies \n in \n Islamic \n mysticism , Cambridge 1921, 86 ff.). They were rephrased and/or simplified by other authors (cf. Blochet, 86 ff.) and have remained part of the mainstream of Islamic mystical thinking ever since.",
    "An identical conception of the ḳuṭb as the active principle (or interior, bāṭin ; cf. al-Kās̲h̲ānī, 141) in all inspiration and revelation, comparable to the voūc in Neo-Platonism and manifesting itself in the form ( ṣūra ) of a prophet, is found earlier with ʿUmar b. al-Fāriḍ (cf. Muḥammad Muṣṭafā Ḥilmī, Ibn al- Fāriḍ wa ’ l- ḥubb al- ilāhī , Cairo 1945, 273). This idea as noted by Ḥilmī, ibid., 277, has a striking similarity to the Ismāʿīlī [ q.v. ] belief in the personification of al- ʿaḳl al- awwal in ( al- imām ) al- nāṭiḳ . Other authors have equally drawn attention to the similarity between the S̲h̲īʿī conception of the Imām as a manifestation of the Divine Logos and the conception of the cosmic ḳuṭb in Islamic mysticism, or the possible identity of both concepts (see e.g. Kāmil Muṣṭafā al-S̲h̲aybī, al- Ṣila bayn al- taṣawwuf wa ’ l- tas̲h̲ayyuʿ Cairo 1969, 463, and Cor bin, En Islam \n \n ¶ \n iranien , i, 92). Several authors have noted the analogy between the Ismāʿīlī (Fāṭimid) daʿwa hierarchy and the mystical hierarchy under the ḳuṭb (see e.g. al-S̲h̲aybī, 457 ff. and Y. Marquet, Des Iḫwān al- Ṣafāʾ à al- Ḥaǧǧ ʿUmar ( b. Saʿīd Tall ), marabout et conquérant toucouleur , in Arabica , xv [1968], 27) or have regarded the mystical hierarchy as derived from it. The historical possibility of such a derivation was discarded by W. Ivanow, An Ali- Ilahi Fragment , in Collectanea , i, The Ismaili Society, Series A, No. 2, Leiden-Bombay 1948, 166.",
    "Among the S̲h̲īʿī scholars, some have stated explicitly that ḳutb and Imām are terms which have the same meaning and which refer to one and the same person (Amoli, La philosophie s̲h̲iʿte , 223; ʿAllāma Sayyid Muḥammad Ḥusayn Ṭabāṭabā’ī, S̲h̲iʿte Islam (tr., ed., introd. and notes by Seyyed Hossein Naṣr), London 1975, 114; Corbin, En Islam iranien , ii, 76). The notion of the saintly hierarchy headed by the ḳuṭb is considered by H. Corbin as basically a S̲h̲īʿī idea which has been appropriated by Sunnī mysticism (see e.g. his En Islam iranien , i, 229, iii, 279; cf. al-S̲h̲aybī, 213). Several of his publications contain phenomenologically-inclined analysis of the hermeneutics involving conceptions of ḳuṭb in a perspective of Iranism (see e.g. his L’homme de lumière dans le soufisme iranien , Paris 1971, passim , and his En Islam iranien , i, 186 ff.).",
    "Conceptions of a saintly hierarchy headed by the ḳuṭb and distinct from the hierarchy headed by the Imām are found in the works of ʿAziz al-Dīn Nasafī (cf. M. Molé, ed., ʿAzizoddin Nasafi , Le livre de l’homme parfait ( Kitāb al- Insān al- Kāmil ), Bibl. Iranienne xi, Tehran-Paris 1962, 20, 26) and ʿAlāʾ al-Dawla Simnānī ( idem , Les Kubrawiyya entre \n Sunnisme \n et \n Shiisme \n aux \n huitième \n et \n neuvième siècles de \n l ’ Hégire \n , in REI , xxix (1961), 107 f. ; cf. Corbin, op . cit ., ii, 74). Similar conceptions are held in contemporary S̲h̲īʿī mysticism (cf. R. Gramlich, Die Schiitischen Derwischorden Persiens . Zweiter Teil : Glaube \n und \n Lehre \n , Wiesbaden 1976, 160 ff.). S̲h̲īʿī mystics have referred to the twelft̲h̲ Imām as ḳuṭb al-aḳṭāb (Corbin, En Islam iranien , ii, 74-5, iv, 357) or ḳuṭb-i s̲h̲amsī (Gramlich, op . cit ., 158), and to the head of a ṭarīka [ q.v. ] as ḳuṭb , ḳuṭb-i ḳamarī and ḳuṭb-i zamān (idem, 159 ff. for further references and additional detail).",
    "Belief in the existence of aḳṭāb and in the whole saintly hierarchy was denounced by Ibn K̲h̲aldūn (cf. Ibn K̲h̲aldūn. ed. de Slane, ii, 164; iii, 74, 105-6; Ibn Ḫaldûn, Ṣifâʾuʾs- Sâʾil litehzîbi ʾ l-Mesâʾil \n , ed. M.B.T. al-Ṭanjî, Istanbul 1958; H. S. Nyberg, Kleinere Schriften des Ibn al- ʿArabī , Leiden 1919, 113 f.), and has been under attack by those adhering to a nonmystical conception of Islam up to the present day (see e.g. ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Wakīl, Hād̲h̲ihi hiya ’l-ṣūfiyya \n , Cairo 1375/1955, 124 ff.).",
    "The ḳuṭb is regarded as being able to perform distinct karāmāt , which reveal his maḳām (cf. Ibn ʿAṭāʾ Allāh al-Sakandārī, Laṭāʾif al- minan , Tunis 1304/1886-7, 57 f.; and ʿAmmār, i, 193), to know the meaning of the letters at the beginning of the ṣūras , which he has received from God directly—this qualifies him for al- k̲h̲ilāfa (al-Idwī, op . cit ., ii, 98), which is known as k̲h̲ilāfat ūlā ’ l-iṣṭifāʾ \n (see e.g. ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿAlawī b. Ḥasan al-ʿAṭṭās, Ẓuhūr al-ḥaḳāʾiḳ ft \n bayān \n al- \n ṭarāʾiḳ \n , Bombay 1312/1894-5, 263; Muṣṭafā Yūsuf Salām al-S̲h̲ād̲h̲ilī, D̲j̲awāhir al- iṭlāʿ wa-durar al-intifāʿ ʿalā \n matn al-Iṣfahānī Abī S̲h̲ud̲j̲aʿ \n . Cairo 1350/1931-2, 270)—and to incorporate the ṣifāt of the nuḳabāʾ , the nud̲j̲abāʾ , the abdāl and of all those who belong to the saintly hierarchy (al-Gümüs̲h̲k̲h̲ānlī\n Ḏj̲āmiʿ al-uṣūl \n , 4; ʿAmmār, i, 192), \n ¶ in consequence of the fact that he is the means by which al- ḥaḳḳ sees his own names and ṣifāt (cf. ʿAbd al-Karīm al-D̲j̲īlī, al- Insān al- Kāmil fī maʿrifat al- awāk̲h̲ir wa ’ l- awāʾil , Cairo 1328, ii, 48). All secret beings and every animate and inanimate body have to give him their pledge ( bayʿa ) except for the following three classes of beings: al- afrād , who belong to the angels and are independent of the ḳuṭb (cf. Ibn al-ʿArabī, Fuiūḥāt , i, 223); the d̲j̲inn who are under the authority of al-K̲h̲aḍir [ q.v. ] (cf. Muḥyi ’l-Dīn b. al-ʿArabī, Kitāb Manāzil al-ḳuṭb wa-maḳālihi \n wa-ḥālihi \n , Ḥaydarābād 1948, 4); and those belonging to the tenth stratum of rid̲j̲āl al- g̲h̲ayb [see \n al-g̲h̲ayb\n ], namely al- ḥukamāʾ or al- wāṣilūn (cf. al-ʿIdwī, op . cit ., ii, 101). According to Dāwūd al-Ḳayṣarī in his S̲h̲arḥ Muḳaddima al- tāʾiyya al- kubrā (the relevant section is published in al-Tirmid̲h̲ī, Kitāb K̲h̲atm al- awliyāʾ ’, ed. ʿUt̲h̲mān I. Yaḥyā, Beirut 1965, 494 f.) only the awtād [ q.v. ] do not come under the authority of the ḳuṭb : they are equal to him in rank, they owe to God everything they are but they have not been granted the maḳām al- k̲h̲ilāfa ( ibid ., 495). In another treatise, Maṭlaʿ k̲h̲uṣūṣ al- kilam , al-Ḳayṣari states that al-K̲h̲aḍir was the ḳuṭb in secret at the time of Mūsā before the latter became ḳuṭb on the plane of manifest being (see Andrae, 345).",
    "Belief in al-K̲h̲aḍir as a mortal being identical with the temporal ḳuṭb is reported as being held by contemporary S̲h̲iʿī mystics (Gramlich, 146). The possibility of such an identification is implicit in the conception of a mortal K̲h̲aḍir, related by Ibn Ḥad̲j̲ar al-Asḳalānī, al- Iṣāba fī iamyīz al- Ṣaḥāba , Cairo 1358/1939, i, 434-5. This scholar, however, expresses himself in a fatwā to the effect that the orthodoxy of the belief in the ḳuṭb ( al- g̲h̲awt̲h̲ ) cannot be established (cf. al-ʿIdwī, ii, 98).",
    "Early belief in the existence of a saintly hierarchy headed by the ḳuṭb (cf. Nicholson, Studies , 78 f.) seems in the course of time to have been elaborated into a conception of a secret assembly ( dīwān bāṭinī ) where the saints presided over by the ḳuṭb directed the affairs of the seen and unseen worlds (see Aḥmad b. Mubarak al-Sid̲j̲ilmāsī, al- Ibrīz min kalām ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz , Cairo 1292/1875-6, i, 2 ff. Al-Sid̲j̲ilmāsī relates the sayings and ideas of his s̲h̲ayk̲h̲ , ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz al-Dabbāg̲h̲. Al-Dabbāg̲h̲’s description of the composition and functioning of the dīwān has found its way into the works of Muḥammad al-Makkī b. Muṣṭafā b. ʿAzūz, al- Sayf al- \n rabbānī fī unḳ \n al- \n muʿtariḍ ʿalā \n al-g̲h̲awt̲h̲ al-D̲j̲īlān̄ \n , Tunis 1310/1892-3, 74; and ʿUbayd Allāh Ṣāliḥ b. Muḥammad al-Ḳusanṭīnī al-Ḥanṣalī, Fatḥ al- Raḥīm al- Raḥmān bi- s̲h̲arḥ naṣīḥat al- ik̲h̲wān , Cairo 1312/1894-5, 176). This conception is prominent in certain mystical traditions to the present day (see Muḥammad Zakī Ibrāhīm, Maʿ al- Badawī al- muftarī ʿalayhi , in al-Muslim , xv/7 (Cairo, June 1965), 15; and idem , Maʿ ḳaḍiyyat al- \n aḳṭāb \n al- \n arbaʿ \n wa-marātib \n ahl al-g̲h̲ayb \n , in al-Muslim , xx/11 (August 1970), 11 f. : and ʿAbd Rabbihi b. Sulaymān al-Ḳalyūbī, Fayḍ al- Wahhāb fī bay an ahl al-ḥaḳḳ waman ḳalla ʿan al- ṣawāb , Cairo 1964, v, 57 ff.).",
    "Opinions as to the whereabouts of the ḳuṭb vary. According to Ibn al-ʿArabī (cf. Futūḥāt , i, 168; Manāzil al-ḳuṭb \n , 4), the ḳuṭb is corporeally present at Mecca; according to Arimad Muḥammad Riḍwān, al- Nafāḥāt al- rabbāniyya , Cairo 1390, 270, his bodily presence is confined to Upper Egypt. Popular belief in Egypt held him to be miraculously present in a niche behind one of the doors of Bāb al-Zuwayla, the southern gate of Cairo (see E. W. Lane, An account of the manners and customs of the modern \n Egyptians , London 1860, 231 f.; and H. H. Harrison, The \n Bab il Metawalli \n , \n ¶ in MW viii [1918], 141-4), which was a site for veneration and votive offerings (cf. J. W. McPherson, The Moulids of Egypt , Cairo 1941, 141). In contemporary Islamic mysticism, the dominant view seems to be that only his spirit is seen at Mecca, i.e. at the Kaʿba, which is the maḳām [ q.v. ] of his spirit and the throne of his heart (see Muriammad Zakī Ibrāhīm, Kulaymāt mukammilāt li-mawḍūʿ \n al-aḳṭāb \n , in al-Muslim , xv/8 [June 1965], 8).",
    "A few cases are found where a ṭarīḳa teaches explicitly that the ḳuṭb will always belong to this particular ṭarīḳa. \n Examples are al-ʿAzāziyya (see the relevant section in F. de Jong, The \n Ṣūfī \n orders in post- \n Ottoman Egypt , forthcoming) and al-S̲h̲ād̲h̲iliyya (see Ibn ʿAyyād, 105). The latter ṭariḳa teaches that God gave Abu ’l-Ḥasan al-S̲h̲ād̲h̲ilī the bayʿat al- ḳuṭbiyya after the death of Abu ’l-Ḥad̲j̲d̲j̲ād̲j̲ al-Uḳṣurī (b. ʿAyyād, ibid ., 35). The silsila of the ṭariḳa is referred to as the silsilat al-aḳṭāb (Abū Bakr b. Muḥammad al-Bannānī, Madārid̲j̲ al- sulūk ilā Mālik al- Mulūk , Cairo 1330/1912, 90) going back to ʿAlī b. Abū Ṭālib through his son Ḥasan, who is considered the first ḳuṭb (al-Sakandārī, 59 ; Ibn ʿAzūz, 75 ; al-Ḳusanṭīnī, 181).",
    "Distinct cosmological systems revolving around a conception of ḳuṭb and derived from the ideas outlined above, and presenting or incorporating a modified version, have been developed and have gained some degree of significance at distinct times and places. Notable are, in chronological order, Abu ’l-Faḍl ʿAllāmī’s [ q.v. ] presentation of the Mug̲h̲al emperor Akbar [ q.v. ] as insān al- kāmil or temporal ḳuṭb around whom the world revolves in his Akbar- nāma ; Aḥmad Sirhindī’s [ q.v. ] conception of the ḳayyūm —the vicar of God on earth to whom the ḳuṭb is a servant under his rule, a rank which he ascribed to himself and which was claimed by four of his descendants (S. A. A. Rizvi, Muslim revivalist movements in \n Northern India \n in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , Agra 1965, 266 ff.) : this belief seems to have influenced the teaching of Mīr Dard (cf. A. Schimmel, Pain \n and grace . A study of two mystical writers of eighteenthcentury \n Muslim India , Leiden 1976, 81); and Tid̲j̲ām doctrine centred upon the belief that Aḥmad al-Tid̲j̲ānī [ q.v. ] was k̲h̲atm al- wilāya and Tiutb al-aḳṭāb \n simultaneously (J. M. Abun-Naṣr, The \n Tijaniyya . A \n Sufi \n order in the modern world , London 1965, 27 ff.).",
    "Before and after Aḥmad al-Tid̲j̲ānī, Ṣūfīs claimed or were considered to be aḳṭāb. \n Some examples from among the earlier mystics are listed in Gramlich, 168, n. 910). Other notable examples among the later mystics are Abū Saʿīd b. Abi ’l-K̲h̲ayr (see Muḥammad Nūr al-Dīn Munawwar b. Abī Saʿd Asʿad, Asrār al- tawḥīdfi maḳāmāt al- s̲h̲ayk̲h̲ Abī Saʿīd , ed. D̲h̲abīḥ Allāh Ṣafā, Tehran 1348, 352 f.), ʿAbd al-Raḥīm al-Ḳināwī (cf. Aḥmad Ḥusayn D̲j̲abaruh, Kalima mutawāḍiʿa ʿan ḳuṭb Ḳinā sīdī ʿAbd al-Raḥīm al-Ḳināʾī , n.p. Kịnā] 1388/1968); Abu ’l-Ḥad̲j̲d̲j̲ād̲j̲ al-Uḳṣurī (see Ibn ʿAyyād, 35) ; Abu ’l-ʿAbbās al-Mursī (see al-Sakandārī, 68); ʿAbd al-Ḳādir al-D̲j̲īlānī [ q.v. ], Aḥmad al-Rifāʿī Aḥmad al-Badawī [ q.v. ], and Ibrāhīm al-Dasūḳī [ q.v. ]. The last four of these are frequently referred to as al-aḳṭāb al- arbaʿa (see Muḥammad Maḥmūd al-Suṭūḥī, al- Taṣawwuf waaḳṭābuhu , Cairo 1970, 15, 24; cf. Muḥammad Zakī Ibrāhīm, Maʿḳaḍiyyat al-aḳṭāb al-arbaʿa \n , 6 ff.). In some mystical cosmologies they are presented as occupying a position of pre-eminence in the successive stages of pre-creation out of al- nūr al- muḥammadī before their birth, as successors to the four k̲h̲ulafāʾ al- rās̲h̲idūn during their lifetime, and as continuing forces in the world of the unseen after their death \n ¶ (see ʿAkīl Maẓhar, Ḳuṭra min baḥr al- Ḳurʾān ; dawlat Abi ’l-ʿAynayn \n , in Sanābil v (Cairo-Kafr al-S̲h̲ayk̲h̲, April 1967), 41; and Muḥammad Zakī Ibrāhīm, Maʿ al- Badawī , 8 ff. ; cf. idem, Kulaymāt mukammilāt li-mawḍūʿ \n al- \n aḳṭab \n , 8 ff.).",
    "In some mystical traditions, those belonging to the saintly hierarchy, including the ḳuṭb , are held to be identical with the serious mystical teachers present at a certain time but whose spiritual rank remains undivulged to those outside this hierarchy (cf. ʿImrān Aḥmad ʿImrān, al- Talbiya fī wud̲j̲ūd s̲h̲ayk̲h̲ al- tarbiya , Asyūt 1354/1936, 14). This tenet may imply the belief that potentially everybody can become ḳuṭb by means of following the ṭarīḳa , i.e. by means of the method prescribed by a distinct mystical tradition (cf. Sulaymān al-D̲j̲amal, al- Futūḥāt al- ilāhiyya bi- tawḍīḥ Tafsīr al- D̲j̲alālavn bi ’l-daḳāʾiḳ al- k̲h̲afiyya , Cairo 1913, i, 114).",
    "The statement by J. S. Trimingham, The \n Sufi \n orders in Islam , Oxford 1971, 163 f., that the conception of the ḳuṭḅ has gone through a process of vulgarisation would seem to be in need of further substantiation."
