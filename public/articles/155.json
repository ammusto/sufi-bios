    "( a. ), a term of Ṣūfī mysticism, referring to the intermediate moment between two “spiritual stations” ( maḳām ), represented as a halting ( waḳfa ) and described as a state of stupor and of the loss of reference points acquired since the preceding stage. The mawḳif is a dynamic psychological state, in which the connection between the mystic and God becomes overturned, and sometimes suspended (annihilation in God, the so-called fanā [see \n baḳāʾ wa-fanāʾ\n ]). The best example of the course of such an experience is given in the work of al-Niffarī (d. ca . 366/976-7 [ q.v. ]), his K. al-Mawāḳif wa ’l-muk̲h̲āṭabāt , ed. and Eng. tr. A.J. Arberry, London 1935, Fr. tr. M. Kâbbal, Le Livre \n des stations , Paris 1989; see also P. Nwyia, Textes inédits de Niffarî , in Trois \n oeuvres \n inédites de \n mystiques musulmans , Beirut 1973; idem, Exégèse \n coranique et langage mystique , Beirut 1970, 348-407. The term continued to be employed in classical Ṣūfism (e.g. by Ibn al-ʿArabī, Futūḥāt , Cairo 1329/1911, 392-3, who refers explicitly to al-Niffarī)."
