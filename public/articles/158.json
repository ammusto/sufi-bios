    ", Abu ’l-Ḥusayn (or Abu ’l-Ḥasan ) Aḥmad \n b. Muḥammad al-Bag̲h̲awī, Ṣūfī mystic, of K̲h̲urāsānī background, was born (probably ca . 226/840, as he had met Dhu ’l-Nūn) in Bag̲h̲dād, where he spent most of his life. He died in 295/907. The most extensive information about him is given by al-Sarrād̲j̲ and al-Kalābād̲h̲ī; the brief biographies of al-Sulamī and Abū Nuʿaym agree almost verbatim, as do the Persian notes in Anṣārī and Jāmī. ʿAṭṭār’s biography elaborates on otherwise little-known details; Baḳlī devotes five chapters (§§ 95-9) of his S̲h̲arḥ-i s̲h̲aṭḥiyyāt to al-Nūrī.",
    "It is said that he acquired his surname because “he radiated light when talking”; he claimed “I looked into the light until I became that light myself.” A disciple of al-Ṣarī as-Saḳaṭī, he underwent extreme self-mortification: “Ṣūfism is leaving all pleasures of the nafs \n ”, and emphasised the true faḳīr’s reliance upon God alone. His best-known quality is īt̲h̲ār , i.e. that “it is a religious duty to prefer one’s companions to oneself; for “Ṣūfism consists not of forms and sciences but of ak̲h̲lāḳ , good qualities.” That is illustrated by his attitude during the trial of the Ṣūfīs by G̲h̲ulām K̲h̲alīl in 264/877, where he offered up his life for his friends, whereupon the caliph acquitted the Ṣūfīs. Al-Nūrī was quite emotional, and considered intellect to be “incapable”; contrary to the sober and prudent D̲j̲unayd he enjoyed participating in the samāʿ : “The Ṣūfī is one who hears the samāʿ ”, and Baḳlī asks in his threnody ( Sharḥ , § 377) “Where is the singing, tarannum , of Nūrī?” That his death was caused by his running, in full ecstasy, into a freshly-cut reedbed and dying from wounds, fits into this picture, as does Anṣārī’s remark that “he was more worshipping, aʿbad , than D̲j̲unayd.” Al-Nūrī, who, according to ʿAṭṭār, was seen weeping along with the sad Iblīs, claimed to be a lover, ʿās̲h̲iḳ , which led the Ḥanbalīs to declare him a heretic; but for him, maḥabba (mentioned in Ḳurʾān, V, 59) was a higher stage than ʿis̲h̲ḳ , and “Love is to tear the veils and unveil the secrets.” More dangerous seemed his remark “Deadly poison!”, when hearing the muʾad̲h̲d̲h̲in ’s call, but answering a dog’s barking with labbayka ; he intended to blame the one who performed religious duties for money, but understood every creature’s praise of God, even from the dog’s mouth.",
    "Al-Kalābād̲h̲ī mentions that al-Nūrī wrote about mystical sciences with is̲h̲ārāt , symbolic expressions, but only recently did P. Nwyia discover his Maḳāmāt al-ḳulūb , which contains descriptions of the heart, that house of God, which is inhabited by the King Certitude, who is aided by two viziers, Fear and Hope. Such an allegorical interpretation of Ḳurʾānic data appears also in the comparison of the heart to a castle with seven ramparts (reminiscent of St. Theresa’s imagery). The language of al-Nūrī, called by ʿAṭṭār laṭīf ẓarīf , “fine and elegant”, is highly poetical, and a number of brief poems is attributed to him; the imagery of the heart as a garden which is fertilised, or else destroyed, by rain and in which laud and gratitude are the odoriferous herbs, prefigures Persian garden imagery. Al-Nūrī is called “the faithful one, ṣāḥib al-wafāʾ , and “prince of hearts”, amīr al-ḳulūb , and, as a true love mystic, was one of the most remarkable companions of D̲j̲unayd. who said at his death, “half of Ṣūfism is gone”."
