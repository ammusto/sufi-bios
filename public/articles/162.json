    "( a. ), usually rendered \"patience, endurance\". The significance of this conception can hardly be conveyed in a West European language by a single word, as may be seen from the following. According to the Arabic lexicographers, the root ṣ-b-r , of which ṣabr is the nomen actionis , means to restrain or bind; thence ḳatalahu ṣabr \n an \n \n “to bind and then slay someone”. The slayer and the slain in this case are called ṣābir and maṣbūr respectively. The expression is applied, for example, to martyrs and prisoners of war put to death; in the Ḥadīt̲h̲ often to animals that— contrary to the Muslim prohibition—are tortured to death (e.g. al-Buk̲h̲ārī. Ḏh̲abāʾiḥ , bāb 25; Muslim, Ṣayd , trad. 58; Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal, Musnad , iii, 171). The word has a special technical application in the expression yamīnu ṣabr \n in \n , by which is meant an oath imposed by the public authorities and therefore taken unwillingly (e.g. al-Buk̲h̲ārī. Manāḳib al-Anṣār , bāb 27; Aymān , bāb 17; Muslim, Īmān , trad. 176).",
    "In the Ḳurʾān, derivations from the root ṣ-b-r frequently occur, in the first place with the general meaning of being patient. Muḥammad is warned to be patient like the Apostles of God before him (XXXVIII, 16; XLVI, 34; \"for Allāh’s threats are fulfilled\", is added in XXX, 60). A double reward is promised to the patient (XXXIII, 113; XXVIII, 54; cf. XXV, 75). In XXXIX, 16, it is even said that the ṣābirūn shall receive their reward without ḥisāb (which in this case is explained as measure or limitation).",
    "The conception is given a special application to the holy war (e.g. III, 140; VIII, 66); in such connections it can be translated by \"endurance, tenacity\". Form VIII is also used in almost the same sense, e.g. XIX, 66, \"Serve him and persevere in his service\". The third stem is also found (III, 200; see below).",
    "The word is next found with the meaning resignation, e.g. in the sūra of Joseph (XII, 18) where Jacob, on hearing of the death of his son, says \"[My best course is] fitting resignation\" ( fa-ṣabr \n un d̲j̲amīl \n un \n ).",
    "Sometimes ṣabr is associated with the ṣalāt (II, 42, 148). According to the commentators, it is in these passages synonymous with fasting, and they quote in support the name s̲h̲ahr al-ṣabr given to the month of Ramaḍān [ q.v. ].",
    "As an adjective, we find ṣabbār in the Ḳurʾān, \n ¶ associated with s̲h̲akūr (XIV, 5 etc.); cf. thereon al-Ṭabarī, Tafsīr , \"It is well with the man who is resigned when misfortune afflicts him, grateful when gifts of grace become his\"; and Muslim, Zuhd , trad. 64, \"Wonderful is the attitude of the believer; everything is for the best with him; if something pleasant happens to him, he is thankful and this proves for the best with him; and if misfortune meets him, he is resigned and this again is for the best with him.\" The ideas of ṣabr and s̲h̲ukr are also associated in al-G̲h̲azālī, see below.",
    "The later development of the conception is, of course, also reflected in the commentaries on the Ḳurʾān; it is difficult to say in how far these interpretations are already inherent in the language of the Ḳurʾān. In any case, the conception ṣabr , in all its shades of meaning, is essentially Hellenistic in so far as it includes the ἀταραξία of the Stoic, the patience of the Christian and the self-control and renunciation of the ascetic; cf. below. In place of many other explanations of the commentators, we will give here only that of Fak̲h̲r al-Dīn al-Rāzī ( Mafātīḥ al-g̲h̲ayb , Cairo 1278, on III, 200). He distinguishes four kinds of ṣabr : (1) endurance in the laborious intellectual task of dealing with matters of dogma, e.g. in the doctrine of tawḥīd , ʿadl , nubuwwa , maʿād and disputed points; (2) endurance in completing operations one is bound or recommended by law to do; (3) steadfastness in refraining from forbidden activities; and (4) resignation in calamity, etc. Muṣābara is, according to him, the application of ṣabr to one’s fellow-creature (like neighbours, People of the Book), refraining from revenge, the arm bi’l-maʿrūf wa’l-nahy ʿani s’l-munkar , etc.",
    "The high value laid upon ṣabr is also seen in the fact that al-Ṣabūr is included among the beautiful names of God. According to the Lisān (s.v. ṣ-b-r ), Ṣabūr is a synonym of ḥalīm , with the difference that the sinner need not fear any retribution from al-Ḥalīm, but he is not sure of such leniency from al-Ṣabūr. God’s ṣabr is in the Ḥadīt̲h̲ increased to the highest degree in the saying that no one is more patient than He towards that which wounds His hearing (al-Buk̲h̲ārī, Tawḥīd , bāb 3).",
    "In the Ḥadīt̲h̲ , ṣabr is, in the first place, found in general connections, like, to him who practises ṣabr God will grant ṣabr , for ṣabr is the greatest charisma (al-Buk̲h̲ārī, Zakāt , bāb 50; Riḳāḳ , bāb 20; Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal, iii, 93); in the Ḥadīt̲h̲ also, ṣabr is applied to endurance in the holy war. A man asked Muḥammad: \"If I take part in the Ḏj̲ihād with my life and my property and I am killed ṣabr \n \n an \n and resigned, rushing forward without fleeing, shall I enter Paradise\" And Muḥammad answered: \"Yes\". (Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal, iii, 325). The word is found in other passages in the sense of enduring, e.g. towards the public authorities, \"after my death ye shall suffer things, but exercise ṣabr until ye meet me at the heavenly pool\" ( ḥawḍ ) (al-Buk̲h̲ārī, Riḳāḳ , bāb 53; Fitan , bāb 2; cf. Aḥkām , bāb 4; Muslim, Imāra , trads. 53, 56, etc.). The word here usually has the meaning of resignation, as in the oft-recurring saying, \"The (true) ṣabr is revealed at the first blow ( innamā ’l-ṣabr ʿinda ’l-ṣadmati ’l-ūlā , or awwali ṣadmatin or awwali ’l-ṣadmati , al-Buk̲h̲ārī, Ḏj̲anāʾiz , bāb 32, 43; Muslim, Ḏj̲anāʾiz . trad. 15; Abū Dāwūd, Ḏj̲anāʾiz , bāb 22, etc.).",
    "Significant, in other respects also, is the story of the epileptic woman who asked Muḥammad for his duʿāʾ for her healing; he replied to her that, if she refrained from her request and exercised ṣabr , paradise would be her portion (al-Buk̲h̲ārī. Marḍā , bāb 6; Muslim, al-Birr wa ’l-ṣila , trad. 54). The word is often found in this connection associated with the proper word for \n ¶ resignation, viz. iḥtisāb (e.g. al-Buk̲h̲ārī. Aymān , bāb 9; Muslim, Ḏj̲anāʾiz . trad. 11); with this should be compared the following ḥadīt̲h̲ ḳudsī , \"If my servant is deprived of the light of both his eyes, I grant him paradise in compensation\" (al-Buk̲h̲ārī. Marḍā , bāb 67; Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal, iii, 283).",
    "In conclusion, we may remark that in the canonical Ḥadīt̲h̲ the meaning renunciation is exceedingly rare, a meaning which receives so great an importance in ethico-ascetic mysticism (cf. what has already been said above on sūra II, 42, 148). Bāb 20 of al-Buk̲h̲ārī’s\n Kitāb al-Riḳāḳ (which, like the chapter zuhd in the other collections of traditions, represents the oldest stage of this tendency in Islam) has in the tar-d̲j̲ama: \n ʿUmar said, \"We have found the best of our life in ṣabr .\" Here we already can trace the Hellenistic sphere of thought for which renunciation was the kind of life fitting the true man, the wise man, the martyr.",
    "What the Ḳurʾān and Ḥadīt̲h̲ say about ṣabr recurs in part again in ethico-mystical literature; but the word has here become, so to speak, a technical term and to a very high degree, as ṣabr is the cardinal virtue in this school of thought. As with other fundamental conceptions (see the series of definitions of Ṣūfī and Ṣūfism given by Nicholson in JRAS [1905]), we find numerous definitions of ṣabr , definitions which often point rather to fertility of imagination than give an exhaustive exposition of the idea, but are of great value for the light which they throw upon the subject like lightning flashes. Al-Ḳus̲h̲ayrī in his Risāla , ed. ʿA.H. Maḥmūd and M. Ibn al-S̲h̲arīf, Cairo 1385/1966, 397-404, gives the following collection: “The gulping down of bitterness without making a wry face” (al-Ḏj̲unayd); “the refraining from unpermitted things, silence in suffering blows of fate, showing oneself rich when poverty settles in the courts of subsistence”; “steadfastness in fitting behaviour ( Ḥusn al-adab ) under blows of fate” (Ibn ʿAṭāʾ); “bowing before the blow without a sound or complaint”; “the ṣabbār is he who has accustomed himself to suddenly meeting with forbidden things” (Abū ʿUt̲h̲mān); “ ṣabr consists in welcoming illness as if it were health”; “steadfastness in God and meeting His blows with a good countenance and equanimity” (ʿAmr b. ʿUt̲h̲mān); “steadfastness in the ordinances of the Book and of the Sunna\" (al-Ḵh̲awwāṣ); “the ṣabr of the mystics (literally, lovers) is more difficult than that of the ascetics\" (Yaḥyā b. Muʿād̲h̲); “refraining from complaint\" (Ruwaym); \"seeking help with God\" (Ḏh̲u ’l-Nūn); ṣabr is like its name i.e. [bitter] like aloes ( ṣabr; see the next article) (Abū ʿAlī al-Daḳḳāḳ); \"there are three kinds of ṣabr , ṣabr of the mutaṣabbir , of the ṣābir and of the ṣabbār (Abū ʿAbd Allāh b. Ḵh̲afīf); \" ṣabr is a steed that never stumbles\" (ʿAlī b. Abī Ṭālib); and \" ṣabr is not to distinguish between the condition of grace and that of trial, in peace of spirit in both; taṣabbur is calm under blows, while one feels the heavy trial\" (Abū Muḥammad al-Ḏj̲urayrī; cf. ἀταραξία).",
    "Al-G̲h̲azālī treats of ṣabr in Book II of the fourth part of the Iḥyāʾ , which describes the virtues that make blessed. We have seen that, already in the Ḳurʾān, ṣabr and s̲h̲ukr are found in association. Al-G̲h̲azālī discusses the two conceptions in the second book separately, but in reality in close connection. He bases the combination, not on the Ḳurʾānic phraseology, but on the maxim \"belief consists of two halves: the one ṣabr and the other s̲h̲ukr ”. This again goes back to the tradition \" ṣabr is the half of belief” (cf. the traditions given above which also associate ṣabr and s̲h̲ukr ).",
    "Al-G̲h̲azālī comprises the treatment of ṣabr under the following heads: (1) the excellence of ṣabr , (2) its \n ¶ nature and conception; (3) ṣabr , the half of belief; (4) synonyms with reference to the object of ṣabr ; (5) kinds of ṣabr as regards strength and weakness; (6) opinions regarding the necessity of ṣabr and how man can never dispense with ṣabr ; and (7) the healthfulness of ṣabr and means of attaining it. This division is virtually adopted by Bar Hebraeus [see \n ibn al-ʿibrī\n ] in his Ethikon for the msaybrānūt̲ā (see AJ. Wensinck, Bar Hebraeus’ Book of \n the \n Dove , Leiden 1919, pp. cxvii-cxix).",
    "Only the following out of these sections can be given here. Ṣabr , like all religious maḳāmāt , consists of three parts, maʿrifa , ḥāl and ʿamal . The maʿārif are like the tree, the aḥwāl the branches and the aʿmāl the fruits. Out of the three classes of beings, man alone may possess ṣabr . For the animals are entirely governed by their desires and impulses; the angels, on the other hand, are completely filled by their longing for the deity, so that no desire has power over them and as a result no ṣabr is necessary to overcome it. In man, on the contrary, two impulses ( bāʿit̲h̲ ) are fighting, the impulse of desires and the impulse of religion; the former is kindled by Satan and the latter by the angels. Ṣabr means adherence to the religious as opposed to the sensual impulse.",
    "Ṣabr is of two kinds: (a) the physical, like the endurance of physical ills, whether active, as in performing difficult tasks, or passive, as in suffering blows, etc.; this kind is laudable; and (b) the spiritual, like renunciation in face of natural impulses. According to its different objects, it is called by synonyms like ʿiffa , ḍabṭ al-nafs , s̲h̲ad̲j̲āʿā , ḥilm , saʿat al-ṣadr , kitmān al-sirr , zuhd and ḳanāʿa . From this wide range of meanings, we can understand that Muḥammad, when asked, could answer, “ īmān is ṣabr ”. This kind is absolutely laudable ( maḥmūd tāmm ).",
    "As regards the greater or less strength of their ṣabr , three classes of individuals are distinguishable: (a) the very few in whom ṣabr has become a permanent condition; these are the ṣiddïḳūn and the muḳarrabūn ; (b) those in whom animal impulses predominate; and (c) those in whom a continual struggle is going on between the two impulses; these are the mud̲j̲āhidūn ; perhaps Allāh will heed them. One of the Gnostics (says al-G̲h̲azālī) distinguishes three kinds of ṣābirūn : those who renounce desires, these are the tāʾibūn ; those who submit to the divine decree, these are the zāhidūn ; and those who delight in whatever God allows to come upon them, these are the ṣiddīḳūn .",
    "In section VI, al-G̲h̲azālī shows how the believer requires ṣabr under all circumstances; (a) in health and prosperity; here the close connection between ṣabr and gratitude is seen; and (b) in all that does not belong to this category, as in the performance of legal obligations, in refraining from forbidden things and in whatever happens to a man against his will, either from his fellow-men or by God’s decree.",
    "As ṣabr is an indication of the struggle between the two impulses, its salutary effect consists in all that may strengthen the religious impulse and weaken the animal one. The weakening of the animal impulse is brought about by asceticism, by avoiding whatever increases this impulse, e.g. by withdrawal ( ʿazla ), or by the practice of what is permitted, e.g. marriage. The strengthening of the religious impulse is brought about (a) by the awakening of the desire for the fruits of mud̲j̲āhada , e.g. by means of the reading of the lives of saints or prophets; and (b) by gradually accustoming this impulse to the struggle with its antagonist, so that finally the consciousness of superiority becomes a delight."
