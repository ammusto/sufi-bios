    "( a. ), thankfulness, gratitude; acknowledgment (pl. s̲h̲ukūr ); it also has the meaning of praise, which is gratefulness with the tongue.",
    "1. As a religious and mystical concept.",
    "As a Ṣūfī term for an internal state and its external expression, s̲h̲ukr is a station ( maḳām ) of the wayfarer ( sālik ) and has all the above meanings when referring to human beings.",
    "However, s̲h̲ukr on the part of God signifies the “requiting and commending [a person]” or the “forgiving” a man: or the “regarding” him “with content, satisfaction, good will”, or “favour”: and hence, necessarily, the “recompensing”, or “rewarding, him”. The saying s̲h̲akara ’llāhu saʿyahu signifies “May God recompense, or reward, his work or labour” (Lane).",
    "In the Ḳurʾān, God is al-S̲h̲ākir (II, 158; IV, 147) and al-S̲h̲akūr (XXXV, 29-30; XXXV, 34; XLII, 23; LXIV, 17) the latter also being one of His Most\n \n ¶ \n Beautiful Names, meaning “He who approves, or rewards, or forgives, much, or largely; He who gives large reward for small, or few works; He in whose estimation small, or few, works performed by His servants increase, and who multiplies His rewards to them” (Lane). God is al-S̲h̲akūr \n “in the sense of widely extending His favours, not (thankful) in a literal sense”, giving thankfulness for thankfulness, “just as He has stated, ‘The recompense for an offense is one equal thereto’ (XLII, 40)” (al-Ḳus̲h̲ayrī, 384, tr. Von Schlegell, 132). “Only God ... is absolutely grateful, because His multiplication of the reward is unrestricted and unlimited, for there is no end to the happiness of paradise” (see LXIX, 24) (al-G̲h̲azālī, tr. of al-Maḳṣad , 101) “The one who rewards a good deed manifold is said to be grateful for that deed, while whoever commends the one who does a good deed is also said to be grateful” ( ibid .). So God’s reward, His praise for a good deed is praise for His own work, “for their works are His creation” ( ibid .).",
    "As for human beings, whose qualities are derived from the divine qualities “the thankful one ( al-s̲h̲ākir ) is he who is thankful for what is, and the very thankful one ( al-s̲h̲akūr ) is he who is thankful for what is not” (al-Ḳus̲h̲ayrī, 385, tr. Von Schlegell, 134).",
    "The importance of s̲h̲ukr is clearly expressed in XIV, 7: And \n when your Lord proclaimed: \n “If \n you are thankful , surely I will increase you , but if you are thankless , my chastisement is surely \n terrible” . It is called the key to Paradise on the basis of XXXIX, 74: And they shall say: \n “Praise \n belongs to God , who has been true in His promise unto us , and has bequeathed upon us the earth , for us to make our dwelling wheresoever we will in \n Paradise! How \n excellent is the wage of those that \n labour!”",
    "Al-G̲h̲azālī in his Iḥyāʾ has a comprehensive chapter on ṣabr [ q.v. ] and s̲h̲ukr , which are characterised as the two parts of īmān (which equals yaḳīn , see al-Makkī, 421) which support and complement each other, ṣabr being the precondition for s̲h̲ukr . Since these are divine qualities and yield two of God’s Most Beautiful Names ( al-Ṣabūr , al-S̲h̲akūr ), ignoring them means ignoring not only īmān but also the qualities of God.",
    "Since al-G̲h̲azālī uses the material of the important Ṣūfī compendiums (mainly al-Ḳus̲h̲ayrī and al-Makkī; see Gramlich, Stufen zur Gottesliebe , 4 ff.), structuring it in a clear, logical order with many additions and clarifying similes of his own, this comprehensive chapter will be used here as a basis.",
    "Although mentioned in different ways before, it was one of al-G̲h̲azālī’s most important original ideas to give a clear exposition of the three parts of s̲h̲ukr: (1) ʿilm , “knowledge”, (2) ḥāl , “(the right) state” and (3) ʿamal \n “acting”, and their interrelation with each other.",
    "(1) Knowledge is the real understanding that nothing except God has existence in itself, that the whole universe exists through Him and that everything that happens to a person (including afflictions) is a benefaction from Him. This leads to knowledge of God and His acts, tawḥīd [ q.v. ], and the ability to thank Him which also is a divine benefaction requiring gratitude. Constant awareness of this connects the term with invocation ( d̲h̲ikr ), and those who have gratitude in every situation are those who give praise ( ḥāmidūn ). S̲h̲ukr as knowledge of the impossibility of really thanking God is expressed in the words of Moses: “O Lord, how can I thank you while being unable to thank you except with a second benefaction from you?” God’s answer is: “If you know this, you have already thanked me” ( Iḥyāʾ , iv, 83, 1. 16) Whoever has this knowledge in its absoluteness is a pure s̲h̲ākir .",
    "(2) Deriving from this knowledge is the second part of s̲h̲ukr , the state of joy in the benefactor (not in the benefaction or the act of grace), with the attitude of k̲h̲uḍūʿ \n “humility” and tawāḍuʿ \n “modesty”. Joy in the benefactor, not for Himself but for the caring that prompted Him to give is the state of the ṣāliḥūn [ q.v. ] who are grateful for fear of punishment and hope for reward. The highest degree of the state of joy lies in using the benefaction as a means to reach God’s presence and gaze at His face eternally (al-S̲h̲iblī: “S̲h̲ukr means vision ( ruʾya ) of the benefactor, not vision of the benefaction” [ Iḥyāʾ , iv, 81, 1. 23]). Thus s̲h̲ukr is connected to d̲h̲ikr , the only healthy state of the heart (sūra II, 152: Therefore \n remember Me , I will remember you , give thanks to Me and reject Me not ).",
    "(3) The action in accordance with the state of joy deriving from complete knowledge of the benefactor has three aspects: the (hidden) action of the heart which is intending the good; the (manifest) action of the tongue which is praise of God; and the action of the members of the body, which is using them in obedience for Him and as a means against disobedience as expressed in s̲h̲akwā \n “complaint”, which is thereby diametrically opposed to s̲h̲ukr .",
    "Ignorance of the real meaning of s̲h̲ukr as explained above, and thus neglect and misuse of God’s benefactions, is kufr . The increasing proximity to God through s̲h̲ukr and the increasing distance from God through kufr is expressed in sūra XCV, 4-6: We indeed created man of the fairest stature . Then We \n restored him to the lowest of the low — save those who believe , and do righteous deeds ; they shall have a wage unfailing .",
    "Understanding of the difference between s̲h̲ukr and kufr , which, ultimately, has to be an understanding with the heart, is based on knowledge of all the principles of the religious law brought about by hearing the verses/signs of God and relying on them, which cannot be done without the prophets sent by God. Through this, God’s wisdom in all existing things and the true meaning of His benefaction and its different kinds can be understood, which leads to seeing with the eye of certainty.",
    "2. As a factor in public life and in the principles of law.",
    "In earliest Arabic the term seems to refer to a public proclamation of gratitude or debt. In later Arabic, the term refers also to the affective state of feeling grateful, and is usually tied to the concepts of niʿma (benefaction) and riḍāʾ (contentment/satisfaction).",
    "In the Kitāb al-Ag̲h̲ānī , the poet Ḥuṭayʾa [ q.v. ] is spared by Zayd al-K̲h̲ayl and “when al-Ḥuṭayʾa returned to his people he began praising Zayd, \n ¶ proclaiming ( s̲h̲ākir an ) his benefaction ( li-niʿmatihi ...) (Cairo 1389/1970, xvii, 266 ll. 4 ff.)”. Here and elsewhere (e.g. Naḳāʾiḍ Ḏj̲arīr wa ’l-Farazdaḳ , ed. Bevan, 671-2, 740, 1063) this complex of ideas suggests that sparing life, particularly, evoked a public declaration of gratitude to the benefactor; the relationship thus acquired required some sort of acknowledgment or repayment so that the benefactor was contented. Refusing to acknowledge this benefaction, ingratitude, in this context, was called kufr .",
    "In the principles of jurisprudence ( uṣūl al-fiḳh ), the concept of thanking the benefactor ( s̲h̲ukr al-munʿīm ) was an occasion for controversy: those who believed that the intellect ( ʿaḳl ) contains certain sorts of natural moral knowledge considered “thanking the benefactor” one of the indubitable items of ʿaḳlī knowledge— like the value of equity ( al-inṣāf ) or the reprehensibility of falsehood. Thanking is thus one of the items of moral knowledge known “before the arrival of the s̲h̲arʿ ” in the view of the Muʿtazila, some early S̲h̲āfiʿīs, Ḥanbalīs, and, even, later Ḥanafīs. As̲h̲ʿarīs and later S̲h̲āfiʿīs and Ḥanbalīs denied that such natural knowledge was possible, and al-G̲h̲azālī, in his Mustaṣfā argues that God might have ordained indifference to benefactions, or might have seen feeble efforts to thank Him as impertinent (i, 61). Despite the disparagement of s̲h̲ukr as a piece of natural knowledge, all conceded that it was, after the arrival of the s̲h̲arʿ or revelation, an important element of piety (see al-K̲h̲arāʾiṭī, Kitāb Faḍīlat al-s̲h̲ukr , passim ). It was also an important concept in the construction of artificial social relations, particularly of commander and soldiery (see Mottahedeh, Loyalty \n and leadership , index, s.v. “thanking the benefactor”)."
