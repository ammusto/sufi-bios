    "( a. ), the wool of sheep ( s̲h̲āʾ ḍaʾn ). The hair sheared from other animals is named differently; wabar denotes camels’ hair, s̲h̲aʿr the wool of goats ( d̲j̲ubbat s̲h̲iʿār , a gown made from goats’ hair, see al-Suyūṭī, Ṭaylasān , no. 114). The radical ṣ-w-f is known from pre-Talmudic Hebrew in the sense of “bundle of wool” ( Tosafta ). Ṣūf is mentioned in several pre-Islamic contexts, but in the Ḳurʾān only once in the plural form ( aṣwāf ), in XVI, “82/80.",
    "Sheep breeding ( aṣwāf muʿbarāt al-ritāʿ , the thick wool of sheep pasturing freely, in al-Ṭabarī, iii, 1848 1. 3; cf. Naṣr b. Muzāḥim, Waḳʿat Ṣiffīn , 30 1. 16; al-D̲j̲āḥiẓ, Ḥayawān , iii, 364 1. 3) and wool spinning ( g̲h̲azl al-nisāʾ TA, x, 315 1. 22) were ubiquitous among the Arab tribes during the D̲j̲āhiliyya and in the semiarid zones in the Mediterranean countries during early Islam and later, these regions being unfit for intensive agriculture but suitable for the herds of the Bedouins which roamed in these lands. Thus sheep flocks were a symbol of richness. Nevertheless, with the development of Islamic civilisation, the nomads’ tents were replaced by houses and palaces, and the use of luxury fabrics and furs ( farwa ) grew. It seems that due to this development, the use of wool acquired among the Muslims of the caliphal period an image of coarse cloth ( d̲j̲ibāb ahl al-bādiya , in Ibn al-D̲j̲awzī, Muntaẓam viii, 841. 10).",
    "Market demand stimulated commerce in wool and encouraged partnership between Bedouins and sedentary people (U. Heyd, Ottoman documents on \n Palestine , doc. 46) as well as long-distance land (al-Muḳaddasī, 145 ll. 13-14) and maritime trade in wool (Gil, A history of Palestine 634-1099 , Cambridge 1992, 251 doc. 458 ll. 15-16) Documents from 15th-century Morocco deal with commerce between that country and Portugal ( Sources inédites de \n l’histoire du \n Maroc , l ère série, Portugal , i, 314, 581, iii, 260).",
    "Wool was spun ( g̲h̲azala ) into raw material (R.B. Serjeant, Islamic textiles , Beirut 1972, 72, 92, 80; S.D. Goitein, A Mediterranean \n society , iv, 126-7). It was used in the manufacture of baṭāʾin al-riḥāl (saddle linings), raḥl min s̲h̲aʿr wa-ṣūf (camel’s saddle made from goats’ hair and wool) ḥanbal (rug made of coarse wool, in Sources inédites de l’histoire du Maroc , l ère série, Portugal , \n ¶ i, 44), carpets, bisāṭ , fars̲h̲ (or furs̲h̲ ); and in the garment industries in a variety of woollen clothes ( t̲h̲iyab al-ṣūf ) : \n aʿbiya (woollen cloaks), bus̲h̲t (woollen wraps), aksiya (clothes; kisāʾ min ṣūf (in al-Balad̲h̲urī, Ansāb , iv/4, 86 1. 8), at̲h̲wāb (woollen robes), kilal (veils), d̲j̲ubba (gown) and zaʿbūt (woollen garment); see further, libās .",
    "In local markets different qualities of wool and felt ( lubūd [ q.v. ]) were on sale; these were manufactured in a variety of colours (Ibn Bassām, Nihāyat al-rutba fī ṭalab al-ḥisba , 197).",
    "Wool-makers or sellers ( ṣawwāf al-Ḳāsimī, Dictionnaire \n des \n métiers \n damascains , ii, 275) are mentioned in towns (Goitein, op . cit . i, 105, 419, nn. 37-9; Maya Shatzmiller, Labour \n in the medieval islamic world , Leiden 1994, 120, 123) as well as in the countryside, among sedentary people as well as pastoralists.",
    "The assumption of E. Ashtor ( Les \n lainages dans l’Orient \n mediéval , 1976, 673 ff., repr. in his Studies \n on the \n Levantine \n trade , London 1978) that the system of wool manufacturing in the Islamic Near East declined due to the dumping of European exports, remains to be proved. Thus, for example, one of the guilds in Ottoman Jerusalem, a backwater provincial town, is named ṭāʾifat al-bus̲h̲tiyya or al-ʿabawiyya , the wool craftmen’s association (M. ʿAṭāʾ Allāh, Wat̲h̲āʾiḳ al-ṭawāʾif al-ḥirfiyya , ii, 47-61; for trade in woollen clothes in the European lands of the Ottoman empire, cf. S. Faroqhi, Peasants , dervishes and traders , Variorum edns., Aldershot).",
    "Although wearing a woollen dress was a signal of poverty ( marḳaʿa min ṣūf = woollen rags, in Ibn Iyās), of simplicity (al-Masʿūdī, Murūd̲j̲ , § 2537) and even of asceticism ( d̲j̲ubbat ṣūf ḳubruṣiyya = a long outer garment open in the front, in al-Muḳaddasī, 415 ll. 6-8; t̲h̲iyāb bīḍ g̲h̲ilāẓ , = white, rough dress, in al-Masʿūdī, op . cit ., § 2727), and Goldziher, among others, suggested the hypothesis of the possible association of ṣūf and Ṣūfism, there is nevertheless evidence for the use of wool in luxurious contexts ( fawḳāniyya mulawwana min al-ṣūf \n al-nafts = a coloured robe made from expensive wool, al-Ḳalḳas̲h̲andī, Ṣubḥ , iv, 40; Ashtor, Histoire \n des prix et des salaires , Paris 1969, 176, 344)."
