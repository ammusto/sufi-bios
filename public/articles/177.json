    "( a. ), verbal noun or maṣdar of Form V of wakala \n “to entrust [to someone], have confidence [in someone]”, a concept in Islamic religious terminology, and especially that of Ṣūfism, with the sense of dependence upon God. Tor Andrae pointed out that the verb tawakkala meant “to trust someone in the same way as I would trust my wakīl ”, i.e. the person whom I have chosen to be my procurator or homme d’affaires , to look after my business and to govern and dispose on my behalf. Here he was drawing largely on al-G̲h̲azālī’s etymological analysis of tawakkul in his Iḥyāʾ , Cairo 1352/1933, iv, 223, where he states that it is derived from wakāla , power of attorney or deputyship, “hence one says that one entrusts one’s affairs ( wakala ) to someone, i.e. one \n ¶ relies on him. The one to whom one consigns one’s affairs is called an agent or trustee ( wakīl ). With respect to the one in whom one trusts, one says that one abandons oneself to one’s agent. Thus one entrusts one’s soul to him and depends firmly on him... Hence tawakkul expresses the heart’s confidence in the One Trustee ( al-wakīl al-wāḥid )” (sc. God).",
    "In the earliest Ṣūfī writings is found just such a conception of “religion as tawakkul ” the sum of all acts of pious devotion, the essence of the feeling of “absolute dependence”, which, as Schleiermacher observed, itself is religion. In the Ḳurʾān and Ḥadīt̲h̲ trust in God is a central topic. In the Ḳurʾān, tawakkul is mentioned some 60 times (II, 256, 283, III, 75, 122, 159-61, etc.), with such typical admonitions as “So put your trust in God, if you are believers” (V, 23). In Ḥadīt̲h̲ , we find e.g. “If you trust in God Almighty as it truly demands, He will certainly supply your daily bread just as He provides the birds who fly forth with empty stomachs in the morning but return surfeited at dusk” ( Iḥyāʾ , iv, 211).",
    "In early Ḳurʾānic exegesis, in al-Sulamī’s recension of the Tafsīr ascribed to D̲j̲aʿfar al-Ṣādiḳ [ q.v. ], his description of the interior topography of the heart anticipates later Ṣūfī conceptions of tawakkul as an inner spiritual attitude rather than an external practice (ed. P. Nwyia, in MUSJ , xliii/4 [1967], 181-230); and early debates in Ṣūfism on the propriety of tawakkul in the spiritual life often focussed on the exegesis of Ḳurʾānic verses, e.g. Sahl al-Tustarī (d. 283/896 [ q.v. ]) on XI, 6, “As long as one who trusts in God ( al-mutawakkil ) perceives secondary causes ( al-asbāb ), he is a false claimant”.",
    "From early Islamic times onwards, there were heated debates about the respective virtues of “earning a living” ( kasb , takassub , iktisāb [see \n kasb\n ]) versus pure trust in God ( tawakkul ) (summary of these in Abū Ṭālib al-Makkī, Ḳūt al-ḳulūb , Beirut n.d., ii, 5-6). Like other technical terms in Islamic thought, these discussions partook of the parity phenomenon, where ideas were discussed in terms of linguistic pairs of opposites representing contrary philosophico-mystical or mystico-theosophical positions, so that tawakkul / kasb was often paired with d̲j̲abr / ik̲h̲tiyār , determinism vs. freewill (see e.g. the tale of the lion and the beasts of the chase in Rūmī’s\n Mat̲h̲nawī , ed. and tr. Nicholson, i, w. 900-1200, 1263-1371). It was the ʿIrāḳī school of Bag̲h̲dād, followers of al-D̲j̲unayd (d. 298/910 [ q.v. ]) and his reliance for sustenance on God’s Providence alone, who became the main exponents of the doctrine of tawakkul in early Islam, whereas the K̲h̲urāsānian school of Nīs̲h̲āpūr, following the teachings of Abū Yazīd Ṭayfūr al-Bisṭāmī (d. 260/874 [ q.v. ]) based their doctrine on malāma , blame, and advocated the virtues of kasb . But these were general tendencies rather than clear-cut divisions, and we find individuals who did not fit easily into this categorisation; thus Abū Turāb Nak̲h̲s̲h̲abī (d. 245/859), although a member of the K̲h̲urāsān school, was also famed for his tawakkul (D̲j̲āmī, Nafaḥāt al-uns , Tehran 1370/1991, 49). Those fearful, like the Bag̲h̲dādī Ruwaym (d. 298/310), of reliance on excessive tawakkul , stressed the Prophet’s\n sunna on the virtues of kasb , and debates on the limits of tawakkul abounded in the 3rd-4th/9th-10th centuries. According to Hud̲j̲wīrī, Kas̲h̲f al-maḥd̲j̲ūb , tr. Nicholson, Leiden and London 1911, 146, Abū Ḥamza al-K̲h̲urāsānī, an early advocate of tawakkul , reportedly fell into a pit and refused to call out to be rescued by a party of travellers lest he be thought to have committed himself to anyone but God (cf. further, Nicholson, The mystics of Islam , London 1914, 41 ff.). \n ¶ \n Perhaps the best-known advocate of tawakkul within the Bag̲h̲dādī school was Ibrāhīm al-K̲h̲awwāṣ (d. 290/ 903), who carried the idea of self-abandonment to God to its extreme; al-D̲j̲unayd commented on his death that “the expanse of tawakkul on the surface of the earth has been rolled up” (ʿAbd Allāh al-Anṣārī al-Harawī, Ṭabaḳāt al-ṣūfiyya , Tehran 1362/1983, 348). But most Ṣūfīs by now were increasingly aware of the subtlety of the tawakkul doctrine, literal interpretation of which they tended to regard as naive. Thus al-Ḥallād̲j̲ found it objectionable that al-K̲h̲awwāṣ based his entire mystical doctrine on tawakkul , taking it as “real faith” (Hud̲j̲wīrī, Kas̲h̲f , 290). A subtle point was raised in such critiques as this and others: the sincerity of one’s own devotion is blemished by consciousness of one’s own reliance, and the annihilation of self ( fanāʾ [ q.v. ]) must underlie true realisation of tawakkul . It is clear that most Bag̲h̲dādī Ṣūfīs acknowledged the subtle connection of the two.",
    "It was not long before many mystics began to criticise the classical doctrine of tawakkul as wanting in spiritual sophistication, especially those K̲h̲urāsānians who had little regard for the concept anyway. Abū Bakr al-Wāsiṭī (d. 320/931) considered it, with zuhd , renunciation, riḍā , contentment, and taslīm , submission, as one of the four stations which he regarded as unbefitting of true wisdom ( maʿrifa ), i.e. it was suitable only for dull pedestrians along the Ṣūfī path.",
    "But the dominant attitude which prevailed amongst the mystics was that it was the interior reality, not the external paraphernalia, of tawakkul which really mattered. The great Ṣūfī poet Bābā Ṭāhir ( fl . 5th/11th century [ q.v. ]) devoted the 26th chapter of his Aphorisms ( Kalimāt-i ḳiṣār , ed. D̲j̲. Mas̲h̲kūr, Tehran 1354/1975) to the topic of trust, and voices the idea paradoxically: al-tawakkul nafy al-tawakkul \n “trust in God is the negation of trust in God”, explained by a commentator as “the one who truly trusts in God denies himself any attachment to tawakkul in the sense that he has neither confidence in, nor pays attention to, his own trust”. Here, the poet approaches al-Wāsiṭī’s view that tawakkul is unbefitting of wisdom. It was also recognised that tawakkul and tawḥīd were interconnected and involved the attainment of perfect inner peace, as emphasised by al-G̲h̲azālī in Iḥyāʾ , iv, 210 (cf. A. Schimmel, Mystical \n dimensions of Islam , Chapel Hill, N.C. 1975, 119).",
    "Whilst there were debates about the degrees and authenticity of tawakkul , the classical Ṣūfīs nonetheless generally concurred that there was a moral quality which involved abandonment of freewill and volition whilst beholding God as the supreme source of causality, as the definitions cited by ʿAbd Allāh al-Anṣārī, Ṭabaḳāt , 338, show; in these last, human force and will are negated in favour of absolute divine Providence and Power. Thus tawakkul came to be considered a key component, a pillar of faith, īmān , as by al-G̲h̲azālī. who devoted over 40 pages of his Iḥyāʾ to the subject of al-tawḥīd wa ’l-tawakkul and who laid down four degrees of tawḥīd revealed through the ʿilm al-mukās̲h̲afa , science of mystical unveiling. A similar schema of four degrees, with tawakkul corresponding to one of them, was laid down by the 8th/14th century author Maḥmūd S̲h̲abistarī [ q.v. ] in his short Persian philosophical treatise Ḥaḳḳ al-yaḳīn (Tehran 1365/1986, 310-11), and nearly all the Ṣūfī manuals, whilst enumerating the “stations” ( maḳāmāt ) in different orders, list tawakkul as amongst the initial stages of the Ṣūfī way, preceded by zuhd (cf. e.g. Hud̲j̲wīrī, Kas̲h̲f , 181). Al-G̲h̲azālī further discerned three degrees of trust: (1) that of the confidence ( t̲h̲iḳa ) of a client in his legal agent; (2) a \n ¶ stronger kind, like the absolute reliance of an infant on its mother, which is however unconscious and lacks any deep knowledge of her abilities; and (3), the highest degree, when the devotee trusts in God “like a corpse in the hands of the corpse-washer”, but is nevertheless conscious that his soul is being moved by the Eternal Will of the Divine Power. This tripartite typology of tawakkul proved, in fact, very popular in later Ṣūfī expositions, such as that of the great Čis̲h̲tī saint Niẓām al-Dīn Awliyāʾ (d. 725/1325 [ q.v. ])."
