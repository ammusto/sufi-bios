    "( a. ), two terms of Arabic theological and philosophical discourse, the first, ẓāhir , meaning “outward, external, exoteric sense”, hence “apparent, manifest sense”, and the second, bāṭin , its antonym, meaning “hidden, inner, esoteric sense”. This pair of words occurs together four times in the Ḳurʾān: in VI, 120, to describe the outwardness and the inwardness of a sin; in XXXI, 20, as adjectives to describe God’s blessings, both manifest and hidden; in LVII, 3, as names of God to mean that He is the Outward and the Inward [reality], and in LVII, 13, as opposites portraying both the inside as well as the outside of a thing ( Muʿd̲j̲am alfāẓ al-Ḳurʾān al-karīm , Cairo 1409/1988, i, 141, ii, 732, 733; Lane, i, 219-22, ii, 1926-30).",
    "The S̲h̲īʿa, both the Imāmīs and the Ismāʿīlīs, maintain that the Ḳurʾān has both an outer ( ẓahr ) as well as an inner dimension ( baṭn ). To support their contention they report a tradition wherein the Prophet is stated to have said, “Not a verse of the Ḳurʾān has come down [to me] but it has a ẓahr (a literal expression or an apparent meaning) and a baṭn (an interpretation or an inner meaning)” (al-Ḳāḍī al-Nuʿmān, Asās al-taʾwīl , ed. A. Tāmir, Beirut 1960, 30; Abū D̲j̲aʿfar al-Ṭūsī, al-Tibyān fī tafsīr al-Ḳurʾān , ed. Aḥmad al-ʿĀmilī, Beirut, n.d., i, 9; see also Muḥyī al-Dīn Ibn al-ʿArabī [attrib.], al-Tafsīr , ed. M. al-G̲h̲amrāwī, Cairo n.d., i, 2; al-Suyūṭī, al-Itḳān fī ʿulūm al-Ḳurʾān , ed. Abu ’l-Faḍl, Beirut 1988, iv, 196-8; LʿA and TʿA , s.v. ẓ-h-r ). The aforementioned S̲h̲īʿī tradition further states that the inner dimension has yet another dimension; in fact, it states, there are up to seven or seventy inner dimensions (al-Sayyid Muḥammad Ḥusayn al-Ṭabāṭabāʾī, al-Mīzān fī tafsīr al-Ḳurʾān , Ḳumm n.d., i, 7). Referring to the inner meaning or the interpretation ( bāṭin ) of the Ḳurʾān, the Imām D̲j̲aʿfar al-Ṣādiḳ is reported to have said, “We can speak about a word in seven ways.” One of the followers in the audience, expressing his surprise, asked, “Seven, O son of the Messenger of God?” The Imam replied, “Yes, [not only seven], but seventy” ( Asās al-taʾwīl , 27).",
    "ʿAlī b. Abī Ṭālib is reported to have said, “The apparent meaning ( ẓāhir ) of the Ḳurʾān is elegant, and its inner meaning ( bāṭin ) is profound; the marvels [of the Ḳurʾān] cannot be fathomed and its wonders cannot be exhausted” (al-Faḍl b. al-Ḥasan al-Ṭabrisī, Mad̲j̲maʿ al-bayān fī tafsīr al-Ḳurʾān , ed. Hās̲h̲im al-Rasūlī and F. al-Ṭabāṭabāʾī, [Tehran] 1379/1959-60, ii, 9; see also al-Mīzān , op . cit ., i, 12). In his al-Uṣūl min al-kāfī , ed. ʿAlī Akbar al-G̲h̲affārī, Tehran 1388/1968, i, 228, Abū D̲j̲aʿfar Muḥammad b. Yaʿḳūb al-Kulīnī states, “No-one except the awṣiyāʾ [i.e. the Imāms] can claim that they possess the whole of the Ḳurʾān, both its ẓāhir and its bāṭin \n .”",
    "The Prophet Muḥammad was the recipient of God’s revelation, its transmitter and its interpreter. The S̲h̲īʿa, both the Imāmīs and the Ismāʿīlīs, maintain that God revealed both the Ḳurʾān (often called tanzīl , because it was sent down or revealed) and its exegesis ( taʾwīl [ q.v. ]) to the Prophet. The Prophet, in turn, transmitted the revelation but reserved the transmission of its taʾwīl for the Imāms. The latter therefore have a unique relationship to the Ḳurʾān. In a well-known tradition, \n ¶ related by both S̲h̲īʿī and Sunnī traditionists (with some variations in the wording), the Ḳurʾān is presented as “the greater weight” ( al-t̲h̲aḳal al-akbar ) and the Imams as the “lesser weight” ( al-t̲h̲aḳal al-aṣg̲h̲ar ). The Prophet, according to this tradition, is said to have told the Muslims, “I am leaving among you two things of great weight ( al-t̲h̲aḳalayn ), the Book of God and my kindred ( ʿitratī ), the people of my House ( ahl baytī , i.e. the Imāms), and these two shall never be separated until they return to me at the Pool ( ḥawḍ ) just like these two.” Then the Prophet put together the index fingers of his two hands, coupling them and equalising them in all respects. He added “And not like this,” and extended the middle and index fingers of his right hand, “because one reaches out beyond the other. Indeed, the likeness of these [two things of great weight], is Noah’s ark. He who boarded it was saved, and he who left it was drowned” (al-Ḳāḍī al-Nuʿmān, Daʿāʾim al-islām , ed. Fyzee, Cairo 1963, i, 28, Eng. tr. Fyzee, revised and annotated by I. Poonawala, forthcoming; al-Kāfī , i, 294; Mad̲j̲maʿ al-bayān fī tafsīr al-Ḳurʾān , i, 9; Walī al-Dīn Muḥammad al-Tabrīzī, Mis̲h̲kāt al-maṣābīḥ , ed. Muḥammad al-Albānī, Damascus 1961, iii, 255, 258, Eng.tr. J. Robson, Lahore 1975, ii, 1350, 1353; Wensinck, Concordance , s.v. t̲h̲-ḳ-l ; transmitted by Ibn Ḥanbal, Muslim, al-Tirmid̲h̲ī and al-Dārimī).",
    "Thus it is apparent from the foregoing discussion that the ẓāhir (or ẓahr ) and bāṭin (or baṭn ) of the Ḳurʾān have been identified by the S̲h̲īʿa with the principles of tanzīl and taʾwīl . The former refers to the revealed text of the Ḳurʾān and the latter to its inner, esoteric meaning. Al-Kulīnī’s\n kitāb al-ḥud̲j̲d̲j̲a , in his al-Uṣūl min al-kāfī , and al-Ḳāḍī al-Nuʿmān’s\n kitāb al-walāya , in his Daʿāʾim al-islām , are eloquent testimonies and detailed accounts of their respective views on the subject. It should be noted, however, that in comparison with the Ismāʿīlīs’ use of it, the principle of the ẓāhir and bāṭin is used by the Imāmīs somewhat moderately. The Ismāʿīlīs, in contrast, assert that every exoteric meaning has an esoteric counterpart; therefore, all aspects of religion are divided into ẓāhir and bāṭin . The former consists of exterior aspects, such as knowing the apparent meaning of the Ḳurʾān and performing the obligatory acts as laid down in the S̲h̲arīʿa [ q.v. ]. The latter, on the other hand, is comprised of knowing the hidden, inner, true meaning of the Ḳurʾān and the S̲h̲arīʿa. The ẓāhir , which represents the body, can be perceived by the senses, while the bāṭin , which represents the spirit, is derived by special knowledge called taʾwīl . The apparent meaning of the Ḳurʾān, the Ismāʿīlīs state, perishes in the opacity and servitude of legalist religion. It is necessary to bring out the transparency of its depth, the esoteric meaning. Attaining comprehension of bāṭin / taʾwīl is like a spiritual birth that enables the person to enter a new world, to accede to a higher plane of being. They further contend that the ẓāhir was the miracle of the Prophet while the bāṭin is the miracle of the Imāms ( Asās al-taʾwīl , 31; Abū Yaʿḳūb al-Sid̲j̲istānī, K. al-Iftik̲h̲ār , ed. Poonawala, forthcoming, ch. xii). Al-Ḳāḍī al-Nuʿmān’s\n Taʾwīl al-daʿāʾim , ed. M. Aʿẓamī, Cairo n.d. and al-Sid̲j̲istānī’s\n K. al-Iftikhār are good examples of Ismāʿīlī\n bāṭin / taʾwīl doctrine. The conviction that to everything apparent, literal, exoteric there corresponds something hidden, spiritual, esoteric, is the fundamental principle at the very foundation of Ismāʿīlī doctrine. Bāṭin is the central postulate of esoterism and of esoteric taʾwīl (hermeneutics). Because of their insistence on this principle, the Ismāʿīlīs are very often called al-Bāṭiniyya by their opponents, and they are \n ¶ classified as extremist S̲h̲īʿa by the Muslim heresiographers (see ʿAbd al-Ḳāhir al-Bag̲h̲dādī, al-Farḳ \n bayn \n al-firaḳ , ed. M. Muḥyī al-Dīn, Cairo n.d., 281 ff.; al-S̲h̲ahrastānī, al-Milal wa ’l-niḥal , ed. ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz al-Wakīl, Cairo 1968, i, 192; al-G̲h̲azālī, Faḍāʾiḥ al-bāṭiniyya , ed. ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Badawī, Cairo 1964; I. Goldziher, Streitschrift des Gazālī gegen die Bāṭinijja-Sekte , Leiden 1916; Abū Muḥammad al-Yamanī, ʿAḳāʾid al-t̲h̲alāt̲h̲ wa-sabʿīna firḳa , ed. Muḥammad al-G̲h̲āmidī, Medina 1414/1993, ii, 477). The Zaydīs are opposed to Bāṭinī taʾwīl as practiced by Ismāʿīlīs and Imāmīs. Druzes [see \n durūz\n ], on the other hand, affirm that the Bible, the Ḳurʾān and their own scriptures have esoteric as well as exoteric meanings. They further maintain that in addition to these two levels of meaning there is yet another level, called “the esoteric of the esoteric” (Samy Swayd, The Druzes . An annotated bibliography , Kirkland, Wash. 1998, 36).",
    "The Ṣūfīs also maintain this principle of ẓāhir and bāṭin with regard to the Ḳurʾān. The tafsīr of Sahl al-Tustarī (d. 283/896 [ q.v. ]), one of the oldest extant works representing mystical interpretation of the Ḳurʾān, is a good case in point. At the basic level of interpretation al-Tustarī’s division is twofold: ẓāhir (exoteric) and bāṭin (esoteric). The former aspect comprises mostly traditions ( aḥādīt̲h̲ ) explaining religious law, occasions of revelations, and other obvious matters, while the latter aspect comprises mystical explanations. Referring to the Ḳurʾān, at the beginning of the tafsīr , al-Tustarī states, “Its apparent meaning ( ẓāhir ) is beautiful and its inner meaning ( bāṭin ) is profound, and no mind is capable of comprehending it” ( Tafsīr al-Ḳurʾān al-ʿaẓīm , Cairo 1326/1908, 2; G. Böwering, The mystical vision of existence in classical Islam . The Qurʾānic \n hermeneutics of the \n Ṣūfī Sahl al-Tustarī , New York 1980, 139). Further explaining the meaning of the Ḳurʾānic verses, he states, “Each verse has four levels of signification: a ẓāhir , a bāṭin , a ḥadd and a maṭlaʿ (or muṭṭalaʿ ). The ẓāhir is the recitation of that verse, the bāṭin is its [proper] understanding, the ḥadd defines what is lawful and what is unlawful, and the maṭlaʿ (the point of transcendency) or the muṭṭalaʿ (anagogical meaning) is the spectacle of the heart and its meaning intended by God” (see also al-Sulamī, Ḥaḳāʾiḳ al-tafsīr , in Böwering, The mystical vision , 140; this fourfold division is attributed by al-Sulamī to ʿAlī b. Abī Ṭālib in Itḳān ).",
    "Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Sulamī’s (d. 412/1021) Ḥaḳāʾiḳ al-ṭafsīr , which holds a unique place in the history of Ṣūfī\n tafsīr , also uses the distinction of ẓāhir and bāṭin (Böwering, The Qurʾān \n commentary of \n Sulamī , in Islamic \n studies presented to \n Charles Adams , ed. W. Hallaq and D.P. Little, Leiden 1991, 41-56; al-Sulamī, Ziyādāt ḥaḳāʾiḳ al-tafsīr , ed. Böwering, Beirut 1995, 1, 24, 38, 42, 43, 101, 106.) This trend of Ṣūfī esoteric interpretation of the Ḳurʾān was continued by Rūzbihān al-Baḳlī (d. 606/1209), Ibn al-ʿArabī (d. 638/1240), and others."
