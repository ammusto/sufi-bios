    "( a. ), literally, “one who gives right guidance, rus̲h̲d , irs̲h̲ād , in Ṣūfī mystical parlance, the spiritual director and initiator into the order ( ṭarīḳa ) of the novice or murīd [ q.v. ] who is following the Sūfi path; synonyms are baba , pīr and s̲h̲ayk̲h̲ [ q.vv .]. As part of the guidance for the postulant, the murs̲h̲id bestows various tokens of spiritual grace and attainment upon the seeker [see \n murīd for details ].",
    "A special use of the term within the Persian world, in the compound form murs̲h̲id-i kāmil \n “perfect spiritual director”, occurred amongst the Ṣafawids [ q.v. ] who ruled during the 10th-early 12th/16th-early 18th centuries in Persia. From our first knowledge of the Ṣafawiyya Ṣūfī order in 8th/14th century Ād̲h̲arbāyd̲j̲ān, it seems that its s̲h̲ayk̲h̲s , from their base at the Ardabīl [ q.v. ] shrine of the founder, assumed this title of murs̲h̲id-i kāmil , demanding complete obedience from all their adherents. This requirement continued to be exacted by the Ṣafawid S̲h̲āhs when they had also become temporal monarchs, pādis̲h̲āhs [ q.v. ], in Persia as a whole, with resultant stresses within the state and tensions amongst the loyalties of their servants.
