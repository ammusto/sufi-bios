    "The original meaning of the root ḥḳḳ has become obscured in Arabic but can be recovered by reference to the corresponding root in Hebrew with its meanings of (a) “to cut in, engrave” in wood, stone or metal, (b) “to inscribe, write, portray” (this also in a Canaanite inscription of the 8th cent. B.C.; S. A. Cooke, North-Semitic \n inscriptions , Oxford 1903, 171, 185), (c) “to prescribe, fix by decree”, therefore “prescribed, decree, law, ordinance, custom”, (d) “due to God or man, right, privilege” (cf. Brown-Driver-Briggs, Hebrew and \n English \n lexicon , Oxford 1952; L. Koehler and A. W. Baumgartner, Lexicon \n in \n Veteris Testamenti libros , Leiden 1953). The word ḥaḳḳ , meaning “something right, true, just, real”, is common in pre-Islamic poetry (the index prepared by the School of Oriental Studies of the Hebrew University lists 916 places in edited texts); it also occurs, with the meaning “truth”, in the proverbs of the Arabs (Maydānī, ed. Freytag, Arabum \n proverbia , nos. 85, 123, 232). Derived from this again is ḥaḳḳ as a Divine Name. This is already attested, in the forms ḥqt and ḥq , in the South Arabic inscriptions (Y. Moubarac, Les noms , titres et attributs de Dieu dans le Coran et leurs correspondants en épigraphie sud-sémitique , in Muséon , 1955, 86 ff.), and it occurs also in the Arabic translation of the Diatessaron (A. Ciasca, Tatiani Evangeliorum Harmoniae Arabice , Rome 1888, 172, on John, XIV, 6).",
    "The primary meaning of ḥaḳḳ in Arabic is “established fact” ( al-t̲h̲ābit ḥaḳīḳat an \n ), and therefore “reality”, and the meaning “what corresponds to facts”, and therefore “truth”, is secondary; its opposite is bāṭil (in both meanings). This is well stated by D̲j̲urd̲j̲ānī ( Taʿrīfāt , s.v. ), whereas some of the lexicographers start from the secondary meaning (cf. Lane, Lexicon , s.v. ). Ḥaḳḳ in its primary meaning is one of the names of Allāh (cf. al-asmāʾ al-ḥusnā , no. 52), and it occurs often in the Ḳurʾān in this sense, as the opposite of bāṭil . The commentators of the Ḳurʾān usually explain it as t̲h̲ābit ( e.g. , Bayḍāwī on sūra X, 32; XX, 114; XXII, 6, 62; XXXI, 30). A similar usage is implied in pre-Islamic poetry, by the use of the antonym bāṭil , in the verse of Labīd ( Dīwān , ed. Huber, xli, 9): a-lā kullu s̲h̲ayʾin mā k̲h̲ala ’llāha bāṭilu , “Lo, everything except Allāh is vain, unreal.” (The occasional explanation of the Divine Name ḥaḳḳ as “Creator” is based merely on its alliterative contrast with k̲h̲alḳ , “creation”. For another explanation, see Massignon, K. al-Ṭawāsīn , 174). But the use of ḥaḳḳ in the Ḳurʾān, in Islamic traditions (cf. Wensinck, Concordance et indices , s.v. ), and in Arabic literature in general, is not restricted to the Divine Name; it may refer to any “reality”, “fact”, or “truth”; thus, the features of the Day of Judgment, Paradise and Hell are ḥaḳḳ . A further meaning of ḥaḳḳ (pl. ḥuḳūḳ ) deriving directly from the primary one, is “claim” or “right”, as a legal obligation [see \n ḥuḳūḳ\n ]; this use of the term is already fully developed in the Ḳurʾān. Islamic religious law distinguishes the ḥaḳḳ Allāh , mainly Allāh’s penal ordinances, and the ḥaḳḳ al-ādamī , the civil right or claim of a human.",
    "In Ṣūfī terminology, ḥaḳḳ al-yaḳīn , an expression taken from sūra LVI, 95, is that “real certainty”\n \n ¶ which comes to the creature with his passing away ( fanāʾ ) in his ḥāl after he has acquired visual certainty ( ʿayn al-yaḳīn ) and intellectual certainty ( ʿilm al-yaḳīn ); cf. D̲j̲urd̲j̲ānī, Taʿrīfāt , s.v. ; Ḳus̲h̲ayrī, Risāla , Būlāḳ 1290, ii, 99 ff. In Ṣūfī terminology, too, the ḥuḳūḳ al-nafs are such things as are necessary for the support and continuance of life as opposed to the ḥuẓūẓ , things desired by the nafs but not necessary to its existence. The use of the formula ana ’l-ḥaḳḳ , ‘I am the Ḥaḳḳ” by al-Ḥallād̲j̲ [ q.v. ] was one of the counts on which he was condemned and executed.",
    "To sum up, the meanings of the root ḥḳḳ started from that of carved, permanently valid laws, expanded to cover the Ethical ideals of right and real, just and true, and developed further to include Divine, Spiritual Reality."
