    "(pl. aḥwāl ), Ṣūfī technical term ( iṣtilāḥa ) which can be briefly translated by “spiritual state”. D̲h̲u ’l-Nūn al-Miṣrī (d. 245/859) outlines the distinction which was to become classic between aḥwāl (“states”) and maḳāmāt (“stations”). We find a more highly developed elaboration in his contemporary in Bag̲h̲dād, Ḥārit̲h̲ al-Muḥāsibī (165-243/781-857).",
    "The term ḥāl belonged to the technical vocabulary of the grammarians, the physicians and the jurists. It seems indeed (cf. L. Massignon, Passion d’al-Ḥallâj , Paris 1922, 554) that it was from the medical vocabulary that al-Muḥāsibī borrowed it. In medicine, ḥāl denotes “the actual functional (physiological) equilibrium” of a being endowed with nafs ; in taṣawwuf , it was to become the actualization of a divine “encounter” ( wad̲j̲d ),—the point of equilibrium of the soul in a state of acceptance of this encounter. Here, and in the later elaboration of the Ṣūfī vocabulary, the original meanings of the grammatical and medical vocabularies approach each other. In grammar, ḥāl is the state of the verb in relation to the agent, its “subjective” state. This last notion, which was to be of very direct influence on the philosophical vocabulary of the science of kalām ( ḥāl = intermediate modality between being and non-being, Fak̲h̲r al-Dīn al-Rāzī, Muḥaṣṣal , Cairo n.d., 38), was for its part to connote many analyses of taṣawwuf . In short, the aḥwāl can there be defined as modalities of activation, realities essentially “instantaneous” and trans-temporal, which seize the “state” of the subject in the act of “encounter” with an internal “favour” ( fāʾida ), received from God (al-Muḥāsibī).",
    "Thus two notions colour the Ṣūfī ḥāl : 1) the idea of activation, of point of equilibrium, and thus of temporal non-succession (which does not necessarily imply non-stability); 2) the idea of “encounter”, and hence that the activation takes place under the impact of this “encounter”, which will be directly or indirectly related to God. The definition of ḥāl as “passive state” often given by Western interpreters appears to be inadequate as a rendering of the exact sense, and transposes too abruptly into taṣawwuf a term of Christian mysticism (see below).",
    "Ḥāl appears many times in Ṣūfī texts as the opposite and complement ( muḳābal ) of maḳām , or waḳt or tamkīn .",
    "The maḳāmāt are the “places”, the progressive stations that the soul has to attain in its search for God. In general, the authors insist upon the “effort” of the soul in its approach to the maḳāmāt , just as they emphasize the “received” character of ḥāl \n Although the distinction can sometimes apply to the “active” states and “passive” states of Christian mysticism, the equivalence does not appear to be total; to adhere to it would be to falsify the meaning of certain Ṣūfī analyses.—The maḳāmāt and the aḥwāl are clearly presented as two series of spiritual states, the first acquired, the second received; hence, in the manuals and in descriptions of the soul’s ascent, the maḳāmāt generally precede the aḥwāl . But in fact the difference is one of perspective and stage of analysis. Both are readily called (as with al-Anṣārī and his commentators; cf. also Ibn al-ʿArīf, etc.) manāzil , the traveller’s “halts” along the route, the restingplaces. Maḳām evokes the staging posts which continue to remain available—to reach a new maḳām does not destroy the preceding maḳām ; the ḥāl , on the contrary, is by nature “instantaneous”, there is a succession or alternation of aḥwāl , there may be a stabilization of one or the other, but not \n ¶ a concomitance of several: the heart possessed by a ḥāl is seized entirely, even though this ḥāl evokes, as it were spontaneously, a second which finally brings it to perfection and denies it (dialectic of the muḳābals ).",
    "Two remarks follow from this: (a) The same manzil , the same resting-place, according to the authors and their analytical processes, may be classed among either the maḳāmāt or the aḥwāl , for example, maḥabba (love of the soul and of God). For al-Kalābād̲h̲ī, this is the loftiest of the maḳāmāt reached; and for al-Anṣārī, the first of the aḥwāl (cf. Anawati and Gardet, Mystique musulmane , Paris 1961, 127-8 and n. 10). (b) Repentance, asceticism, long-suffering, poverty, humility, fear of God, piety, sincerity, etc., the maḳāmāt follow one after another, the order no doubt varying to suit each particular treatise, but obeying a progressive principle. The aḥwāl , on the other hand, are subject to every sentiment that takes possession of the soul during its quest for God, and they can be received, according to the various degrees of activation, equally well at the start as during the progress or at the conclusion of the procedure. In conformity with a psychological law upon which the writers of taṣawwuf insist, they often present themselves in muḳābal , in pairs of complementary opposites— contraction and dilation of the heart ( ḳabḍ and basṭ ); absence and presence ( g̲h̲ayba and s̲h̲uhūd ); annihilation and survival (in God: fanāʾ and baḳaʾ ), etc.",
    "It would be fruitless to attempt to draw up precisely defined lists of maḳāmāt and aḥwāl . Different examples are to be found in practically every treatise of Ṣūfism, e.g. , the Lumaʿ of al-Sarrād̲j̲ (seven maḳāmāt and about ten aḥwāl ), the Kitāb al-Taʿarruf of al-Kalābād̲h̲ī, the Manāzil of al-Anṣārī (ten aḥwāl , no “section” entitled maḳāmāt ), etc.",
    "It must also be noted that certain writers, basing their analyses upon the etymological meanings of these terms, maintain that ḥāl , once received through pure grace, can become maḳām through the zeal of the recipient. “If the ḥāl endures, it becomes a possession ( milk ) and is then called maḳām . The aḥwāl are given, the maḳāmāt are acquired; the aḥwāl come from the gift itself, the maḳāmāt are produced by the zeal of the man who perseveres in striving”, says al-Ḏj̲urd̲j̲āni ( Taʿrīfāt , ed. Flügel, 85): establishing a continuity between ḥāl and maḳām , the activation received in the soul being as it were destined to be possessed by it. A further point to note is a phrase of al-Hud̲j̲wīrī, according to whom “the fleeting state ( ḥāl ) of the saint is the permanent station ( maḳām ) of the prophet” ( Kas̲h̲f al-Maḥd̲j̲ūb , English trans, by R. A. Nicholson, Leiden-London 1911, 236). In general, however (cf. below, § 3), the stabilized ḥāl is rendered by some word other than maḳām .",
    "Unlike\n maḳām , waḳt may be said to occur on the same analytical level as ḥāl . As we have seen, ḥāl evokes a point of equilibrium, the impact of an “encounter”. Waḳt (time) must not be understood as a temporal measure; it transcends measured and measurable time, it is “the unit of psychic measure” (L. Massignon, op . cit ., 556) of the wad̲j̲d , of the encounter, or its absence; cf. al-Hud̲j̲wīrī ( op . cit ., 368) for whom, to “the time of encounter”, there corresponds “the time of absence ( faḳd ) ” . A whole Ṣūfī line, culminating in Ibn ʿAbbād of Ronda, professes “the spirituality of time”. But it is frequently emphasized ( e.g. , al-Hud̲j̲wīrī, 369) that waḳt \n “has need of ḥāl ”, that “ ḥāl (state) is that \n ¶ which descends upon ‘time’ ( waḳt ) and adorns it, as the spirit adorns the body”. It is the actualization of ḥāl which makes it possible not to lose waḳt , and it is thanks to waḳt that the ḥāl received is actualized in the soul. According to the degree of completeness of the spiritual experience, emphasis will be placed on either the one or the other. It is said that Jacob was the possessor of waḳt , while Abraham possessed ḥāl . Similarly, ḥāl qualifies the object of desire ( murād ) and waḳt the degree introspectively attained by the one who desires ( murīd ). So much so that the murīd (which connotes the idea of novice, beginner) “is with himself in the pleasure of waḳt ”, and the murād \n “[is] with God in the delight of ḥāl ” (al-Hud̲j̲wīrī, op . cit ., 370).",
    "Ḥāl , an inner received state, may well at the start of the spiritual life be burdened with speech; however, it must succeed in transcending every description ( naʿt ), just as wad̲j̲d inserted in time shatters time, when from “encounter” it becomes “ecstasy” (cf. al-Kalābād̲h̲ī, Kitāb al-Taʿarruf , ed. Arberry, Cairo 1352/1933, 54).",
    "Muhāsibī, taking his idea of ḥāl from the medical vocabulary (cf. above), laid stress on the point of equilibrium experienced internally, from which it followed that ḥāl , not measured temporally, was enduring. Other writers ( e.g. , al-G̲h̲azzālī, Iḥyāʾ , Cairo 1352, iii, 16-7) emphasize the multiplicity of aḥwāl in the soul, the lack of continuity in their order, and the extreme difficulty of stabilization.",
    "But it is generally stated that ḥāl , the internal reality of self transiens , unstable at the start of spiritual life, can tend to become stabilized—beyond speech and beyond temporal order. The vocabulary of al-D̲j̲urd̲j̲anī, who regards it as becoming maḳām because “possessed” by the subject, here seems to be at fault. For preference, it is the idea of tamkīn , strengthening, stability, that emerges. The maḳām is a place, the station where one remains; tamkīn is the spiritual act of enduring and stability. Tamkīn , says al-Hud̲j̲wīrī, ( op . cit ., 372), is contrasted with talwīn , which indicates a change, an alternating transition from one state to another.",
    "Moreover, maḳām , exactly like ḥāl , can and must be strengthened by tamkīn . And this last is of two kinds, depending on whether the action of God or the subject’s act is dominant. In the second case, it qualifies the maḳāmāt and the aḥwāl and is coloured by them; in the first case, “there are no attributes”. The weak soul could not persist in the act of ḥāl — which may arise, vanish, give way to some new favour. The soul endowed with tamkīn becomes stabilized beyond the reach of every psychological change.",
    "According to al-Anṣārī, the stabilized aḥwāl progressively become “ascendencies”, wilāyāt , then “realities”, ḥaḳāʾiḳ , in order finally to attain the “limits” of the mystical ascent, nihāyāt . Cf. S. de Beaurecueil, introduction to S̲h̲arḥ al-manāzil of ʿAbd al-Muʿṭī, Cairo 1954."
