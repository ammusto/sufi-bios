    "( a. ), love—passion. Although non ḳurʾānic, this word attained a considerable importance in Arabic literature in the broad sense. In analysing it, we corne to recognize the conditions in which Arabic-Islamic sensibility and thought evolved. As al-Daylamī says ( ʿAṭf , §§ 5, 87 ff.), all kinds of minds have their opinions ( maḳālāt ) on love ( maḥab-ba ) \n ¶ and on ʿis̲h̲ḳ , which is its most dynamic form. Desert Arabs, men of letters, great intellectuals ( al-fuḍalāʾ ), theologians, sages, mystics, etc., have all made statements on the causes, the manifestations, the degrees and the aims of love. One of the earliest attempts to define ʿis̲h̲ḳ is the Risāla fī ’l-ʿis̲h̲ḳ of al-Ḏj̲āḥiẓ ( 11 \n Risāla , 161-9; Rasāʾil , ed. Sandūbī, 266-75), and the question so preoccupied men’s minds that a discussion on this theme had already been held in the presence of Yaḥyā b. Ḵh̲ālid al-Barmakī; thirteen representatives of various religious tendencies, one of them a mōbad̲h̲ , took part, according to al-Masʿūdī, who produces their definitions in the Murūd̲j̲ (vi, 368-86), giving in addition quotations from Galen, Hippocrates and others; al-Daylamī repeats some of them.",
    "In its most general acceptation, ʿis̲h̲ḳ describes the irresistible desire ( s̲h̲awḳ , tas̲h̲awwuḳ ) to obtain possession of a loved object or being ( maʿs̲h̲ūḳ ). It betrays, therefore, in one who experiences it (the ʿās̲h̲iḳ ), a deficiency, a want, which he must supply at any cost in order to reach perfection ( kamāl ). That is why it admits of hierarchical degrees ( marātib ), like the perfections aspired to by the soul and the body. Its apparently multiple motivations, however, all come down to one ideality, or consistency of meaning ( maʿnā ), which haunts all beings more or less insistently and clearly: it is the aspiration ( tawaḳān ) towards the Beauty ( al-ḥusn ) which God manifested in the world when He created Adam in His own likeness ( ʿAṭf , §§ 18, 24). Because of this, the eyes and the ears are the noble organs, since they perceive the supports of the beautiful ( al-ḥasan ): a face, a head of hair, a heavenly landscape, melodious sounds, etc. If one adds, as the Greeks taught, that Beauty, Good ( Ḵh̲ayr ) and Truth ( al-ḥaḳḳ ) go back to one indissoluble Unity ( waḥda ), all of the complexity of the convergences, interferences, and contaminations arising in the concept of ʿis̲h̲ḳ will be perceived. In the classical authors, from al-Daylamī to Lisān al-Dīn b. al-Ḵh̲aṭīb, three main lines of development may be discerned. In ascending order, they are: 1) natural love ( maḥabba ṭabīʿiyya ), 2) intellectual ( ʿaḳliyya ) love, and 3) divine ( ilāhiyya ) love.",
    "All natural beings ( mawd̲j̲ūdāt ) are moved by the desire to raise themselves to the degree of existence immediately above them. This dynamism, which runs through the whole of the uni verse, is the uni versai ʿis̲h̲ḳ (Miskawayh, Tahd̲h̲īb , 64 ff.). Between human beings, affection ( mawadda ) grows into passion-love ( ʿis̲h̲ḳ ), the most searching and realistic analysis of which is the Ṭawḳ al-ḥamāma of Ibn Ḥazm [ q.v. ]. It gives rise to psycho-physiological states, which are described with the aid of clichés used especially in poetry (cf. ṣabāba , ʿalāḳa , kalaf , s̲h̲ag̲h̲af , s̲h̲aʿaf , tatayyum , tatabbul , walaʿ , g̲h̲arām , huyām , walah , tadalluh , . . .). Purified of all carnal demands, this passion is sublimated into an attitude of adoration which provokes a mental imbalance ( ik̲h̲tilāṭ ). It is a state of spiritual servitude to an idealised female figure, upon which the “courtly” sentiments of a soul in ebullition ( g̲h̲alayān ) crystallize. The literary formalization of these sentiments in ʿIrāḳī circles in the 2nd/8th-3rd/9th centuries went so far that it is difficult to determine the differing rôles, in their development, of social custom, an oppressive ethical System, and the basic impulse towards the beautiful.",
    "With the falāsifa , ʿis̲h̲ḳ became intellectualised. It became the spontaneous, lucid, and methodical stretching out towards supreme happiness ( al-saʿāda al-ḳuṣwā ), which, for the intellect freed from the illusions of knowledge transmitted through the \n ¶ senses, takes on the meaning of the pure good ( al-k̲h̲ayr al-maḥḍ ). The more the wise man advances in his passionate quest for the one True One ( al-wāḥid al-ḥaḳḳ ), the more he feels growing within him the ineffable joy ( ibtihād̲j̲ ), the absolute pleasure ( al-lad̲h̲d̲h̲a al-muṭlaḳa ), which are secured through the contemplation ( mus̲h̲āhada ) of the perfection and beauty of the necessary Being ( wād̲j̲ib al-wud̲j̲ūd ).",
    "With the Ṣūfīs the amorous ardour of ʿis̲h̲ḳ , in spite of some resistance, becomes a part of the life of faith as a natural development of the measured affection ( maḥabba ) mentioned in the Ḳurʾān (III, 31, XX, 39, etc.). The substitution of ʿis̲h̲ḳ for maḥabba to describe the “essential Desire” for God and the love of God as an essential attribute, which fills the heart of the mystic, seems to have been due to al-Ḥallād̲j̲ (al-Daylamī, ʿAṭf , §§ 163-5). Love is no longer merely an expression of gratitude for the blessings of God; it is no longer content with rigorous ascetism and meticulous ritual observance. It becomes an absolute necessity, entailing neither enjoyment nor alleviation, but intensifying as the reciprocity of perspectives between the lover and the Loved cornes into effect. This evolution of the pair ʿis̲h̲ḳ / maḥabba is not without echoes of that erôs / agapè , but in Islam the relationship between the two ideas is complicated by the concurrent development of the “courtly” and mystical tendencies. When contact with Greek texts came to an end, there was a return to a legalistic conception of love in the works of, for example, al-G̲h̲azālī or Ibn Taymiyya, or to the exaltation of a perfect and pure Idea in, for example, al-Suhrawardī or even Ibn ʿArabī. Whatever the differences of opinion about its content, ʿis̲h̲ḳ is one of the characteristics of mediaeval self awareness, obsessed with the quest for the eternal, the transcendant and the sacred."
