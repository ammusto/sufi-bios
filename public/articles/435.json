    "( a. ) has among its meanings that of voluntary alms, often referred to in Islamic literature as ṣadaḳat al-taṭawwuʿ \"alms of spontaneity\", or ṣadaḳat al-nafl \"alms of supererogation\", in distinction to obligatory alms, frequently also termed ṣadaḳa , but more commonly known as zakāt [ q.v. ]. Both ṣadaḳa and zakāt are considered by Muslim writers to be of purely Arabic derivation; alms being called ṣadaḳa as indicating the sincerity ( ṣidḳ ) of the almgiver’s religious belief (e.g. Ibn al-ʿArabi, Aḥkām al-Ḳurʾān , ed. al-Bid̲j̲āwī, Cairo 1387/1967, ii, 946-7; al-S̲h̲irbīnī, al-Iḳnāʿ , Cairo i, 212; M. Hamidullah, Introduction \n to Islam , Paris 1388/1968, 68; Ibn ʿArabī, al-Futūḥāt al-makkiyya , Būlāk, repr. Beirut 1968, i, 548, followed by al-Zabīdī, Itḥāf al-sāda al-muttaḳīn , Cairo, iv, 163, derives it from ṣadḳ , as being hard on the soul), and zakāt with reference to the increase ( yazkū ) or purification ( zakī ) of the property from which they are given (e.g. Ibn Baṭṭāl al-Rakbī, al-Naẓm al-mustaʿd̲h̲ab , on the margin of Abū Isḥāḳ al-S̲h̲īrāzī, al-Muhad̲h̲d̲h̲ab , Cairo, i, 140). Modern critical scholarship, however, regards both words as \n ¶ borrowings, probably directly from Jewish usage (A. Jeffery, The foreign vocabulary of the \n Qurʾān , Baroda 1938, 153, 194). Ṣadaḳa reflects the Hebrew\n ṣ e dāḳā , which from its original meaning of righteousness developed the sense of alms given to the poor and is commonly used in this sense in Apocryphal and Rabbinic literature, if not already in the Hebrew Bible (cf. F. Rosenthal, Sedaka , charity , in Hebrew Union College Annual , xxiii/1 [1950-1], 411-414). Zakāt is derived from the Jewish Aramaic\n zāk̲h̲ūt̲h̲ā , not attested in classical Jewish sources in the sense of alms (Th. Nöldeke, Neue Beiträge \n zur semitischen \n Sprachwissenschaft , Strassburg 1910, 25, but see J. Horovitz, Jewish proper names and derivatives in the \n Koran , in HUCA , ii [1925], repr. Hildesheim 1964, 206 [62]), but which may have acquired this meaning through its common use as the Targumic rendering of ṣ e daḳa (H.J. Kasovsky, Oṣar les̲h̲ōn targūm Onkelos ( Concordance ), Jerusalem 1933-40, revised ed. 1986, i, 156) in Biblical passages understood by post-Biblical Jews to refer to alms, an evolution that would parallel that of the Greek eleēmosynē (H. Balz and Schneider (eds.), Exegetical \n dictionary of the \n New Testament , Grand Rapids Mich. 1990, i, 428-9; but cf. G. Levi Delia Vida, in RSO , iv/4 [1911-12], 1067-9). Modern Muslims have tended to find the claim of borrowing unconvincing (e.g. Yūsuf al-Ḳarḍāwī, Fiḳh al-zakāt , Beirut 1397/1977, i, 38-9 referring to EI \n 1 ). Borrowed in turn from Muslims, ṣadaḳa and its derivatives are found in the religious writings of Jews and Christians under Islam (e.g. Bak̲h̲ya b. Paḳūdā, al-Hidāya ilā farāʾiḍ al-ḳulūb , ed. Yahuda, Leiden 1912, 211 ( al-ṣadaḳa wa ’l-zakāt ); Severus b. al-Muḳaffaʿ, Miṣbāḥ al-ʿaḳl , ed. Ebied and Young, Louvain 1975, 19). Ṣadaḳa is found as a male personal name for Muslims, starting from the second generation (Ibn Ḥad̲j̲ar al-ʿAsḳalānī, Tahd̲h̲īb al-tahd̲h̲īb , iv, 414-9; A. Schimmel, Islamic \n names , Edinburgh 1989, 41; Brockelmann, S III, 765 (Ṣadaḳat Allāh)), and Jews (S.D. Goitein, A Mediterranean \n society , Berkeley 1967-93, ii, 576 n. 21, vi, 103-4; M. Steinschneider, Die \n arabische \n Literatur \n der \n Juden , Frankfurt 1902, 329, 331 (Samaritans)) and more recently as a Christian surname (G. Graf, Geschichte \n der christlichen arabischen Literatur , The Vatican, v, 138).",
    "1. Ṣadaḳa in the \n Ḳurʾān . Ṣadaḳa and its related verbal forms ( taṣaddaḳa and the assimilated iṣṣaddaḳa ) are used 24 times in the Ḳurʾān. All of the passages except XII, 88, stem from the Medinan period (noted by Horovitz, 212 [68]), but the appearance of the plural form in the sense of alms (not a Jewish usage), the existence of the denominative verb taṣaddaḳa , to give alms (cf. Rosenthal, 423), and its usage in the extended sense of relinquishing a right (II, 280, V, 45, XII, 88) suggest that the history of ṣadaḳa in Arabic is pre-Islamic (cf. J. Obermann, Islamic origins , in N.A. Faris, ed., The Arab \n heritage , Princeton 1944, 109-10), a supposition supported by ḥadīt̲h̲ which depict the giving of ṣadaḳa as familiar to both Arabian Jews and pagans before Islam (al-ʿAynī, ʿUmdat al-ḳārī , Cairo 1308, viii, 302; A.J. Wensinck, Muhammad \n and the \n Jews of Medina , tr. W. Behn, Freiburg im Breisgau 1978, 101). Ṣaduḳa , which appears in Ḳurʾān, IV, 4, in the sense of the bride’s payment, more commonly known as the ṣadāḳ or mahr , is of Arabic origin (J. Wellhausen, Die Ehe \n bei den \n Arabern , in NGW Gott ., xi [1893], 434; Rosenthal, 420-1; the variant ṣadaḳa is not well attested (cf. Abū Ḥayyān al-Andalusī, al-Baḥr al-muḥīṭ , Cairo 1329, iii, 166, not recorded) and appears to be a philologist’s creation (cf. Ibn Ḵh̲ālawayh, Muk̲h̲taṣar fī s̲h̲awād̲h̲d̲h̲ al-Ḳurʾān , ed. Bergsträsser, Leipzig 1934, 24)). In the Ḳurʾān, but not the ḥadīt̲h̲ , zakāt , perhaps formed to rhyme with \n ¶ another Aramaic borrowing, ṣalāt , with which it is so frequently paired in the Ḳurʾān (A. Spitaler, Die Schreibung \n des \n Typus ṣlwt \n im Koran , in WZKN , lvi [1960], 217)), is used only in the singular, like the Hebrew ṣedaḳa , and has no denominative verb corresponding to its sense of giving alms (noted by W.M. Watt and A.T. Welch, Der Islam , Stuttgart 1980, i, 302, but cf. on the latter point Fr. Schulthess, in ZA , xxvi [1912], 153, and Horovitz, 206 [62]). Zakāt thus appears to have a shorter history as an Arabic word than ṣadaḳa and a more pronounced religious colouring, for only it, not ṣadaḳa , is used in the Kurʾān in connection with prophets before Muhammad (Watt and Welch, i, 302).",
    "According to Arabic lexicographers ṣadaḳa is broader than zakāt and is used in the Ḳurʾān for both voluntary and obligatory alms. It thus happens that certain of the most important Ḳurʾānic provisions concerning zakāt are couched in terms of ṣadaḳa (e.g. IX, 60). In some cases, it is regarded as doubtful whether ṣadaḳa is being used to refer to voluntary alms or zakāt or both (e.g. II, 271). A similar uncertainty extends to verses which refer to \"spending\" ( infāḳ ) (e.g. II, 3) and \"giving\" (e.g. II, 177). To complicate matters, zakāt is on occasion, it is claimed, used to refer to voluntary alms (e.g. Ḳurʾān V, 55, al-Bayḍāwī, Anwār al-tanzīl , ed. Fleischer, Leipzig 1846-8, i, 263 (given by ʿAlī while praying); Ḳurʾān, XXX, 39; al-Ḏj̲azāʾirī, Ḳalāʾid al-durar , al-Nad̲j̲af n.d., i, 284).",
    "It has been argued that the distinction between voluntary and obligatory ṣadaḳa is post-Ḳurʾānic (C. Snouck Hurgronje, La Zakāt , in Selected \n works , ed. G.H. Bousquet and J. Schacht, Leiden 1957, 150-70 [ Verspr . Geschr ., ii, 1-58]). But verses such as II, 177, which refers both to giving one’s property to beggars, among others, and to the giving of zakāt and LVIII, 13, which enjoins those who have failed to give ṣadaḳa to give zakāt , indicate that the Kurʾan does make a distinction between voluntary alms and zakāt , as does IX, 79, which speaks of “believers who give alms of their own accord ( muṭṭawwiʿīn )” (cf. Ibn al-ʿArabī, K. al-Ḳabas fi s̲h̲arḥ Muwaṭṭaʾ Mālik , ed. Walad Karīm, Beirut 1992, iii, 1191). According to the Islamic sources, voluntary almsgiving, already practiced in Mecca, predates zakāt , which was instituted in Medina (e.g. al-Bayḍāwī, Anwār al-tanzīl , on VI, 141; on the date of imposition of zakāt , see Hurgronje, La Zakat , 157; cf. ʿAlī al-Ḳārī, Mirḳāt al-mafātīḥ , Cairo 1309, ii, 409 ( zakāt was imposed in Mecca and regulated in detail in Medina).",
    "The Ḳurʾānic provisions understood to refer to ṣadaḳa in its sense of voluntary alms touch upon themes developed throughout the Islamic tradition. God is spoken of as accepting the alms of His servants (IX, 104). The giving of alms to the poor in secret is said to be preferable to giving openly (II, 271). The proper motivation and demeanour of the almsgiver are indispensable to the religious value of the act: \"O believers, do not render your alms of no account by obligation and insult, like one who expends his property for the sake of appearance before the people while not believing in God and the Last Day\" (II, 264). The expiatory function of almsgiving is already found in II, 196, which institutes fasting, almsgiving, and sacrifice as atonement for the pilgrim’s premature shaving of the head, and more generally in II, 271. The “verse of ṣadaḳa ” ( āyat al-ṣadaḳa ), IX, 103, taken by most interpreters to refer to zakāt , is understood by some to refer to the taking of alms as expiation from certain Anṣārī penitents. The \"verse of audience\" ( āyat al-munād̲j̲āt , āyat al-nad̲j̲wa ), LVIII, 12, enjoins, \n ¶ or at least encourages, the giving of ṣadaḳa before an audience with the Prophet. It is believed to have been in effect only briefly before being abrogated by LVIII, 13 (al-Bayḍāwī, Anwār al-tanzīl , ii, 320, cf. al-Zamak̲h̲s̲h̲arī, al-Kas̲h̲s̲h̲āf , Beirut, iv, 494).",
    "Other Ḳurʾānic verses, although they do not use the term ṣadaḳa , figure prominently in later discussions. Several verses (II, 177, III, 92, LXXVI, 8) stress the significance of giving from what one loves. In II, 267, believers are told to give of the \"good things\" ( ṭayyibāt ) that they have acquired and not to seek out the bad things ( k̲h̲abīt̲h̲ ) that they would not themselves gladly accept, a verse said to have been revealed when usurious income, now prohibited, was being given away as ṣadaḳa. The bountiful reward in store for one who gives \"in the cause of God\" ( fī sabīl Allāh ) (II, 261, seven-hundredfold) or \"to seek God’s pleasure\" ( ibtig̲h̲āʾ marḍāt Allāh ) (II, 265, twofold) is contrasted with the vanity of giving \"in pursuit of the life of this world\" ( al-ḥayāt al-dunyā ) (III, 117). \"Who is it that will make God a goodly loan\" ( ḳarḍ ḥasan ), so that He will increase it many times\" (II, 245; cf. Proverbs, xix, 17) is said to have been revealed with reference to the Anṣārī Abu ’l-Daḥdāh, who gave an orchard of 600 palm trees as ṣadaḳa and was rewarded with one million orchards in the hereafter. Ḳurʾān LIX, 9 praises those \"who prefer over themselves, even though they be in want,\" a passage understood to refer to the Medinan\n Anṣār who, setting an example of self-sacrifice ( īt̲h̲ār ), gave so generously to the Muhād̲j̲irūn (al-Bag̲h̲awī, S̲h̲arḥ al-sunna , ed. al-Arnāʾūṭ, Damascus 1390/1400, repr. Beirut 1403/1983, vi, 181; al-Bayḍāwī, Anwār al-tanzīl , ii, 324). In other passages, however, the Ḳurʾān urges moderation in giving (VI, 141, cf. al-Bayḍāwī, op . cit ., i, 312; XXV, 67).",
    "2. Ṣadaḳa\n in \n Ḥadīt̲h̲. The subject of ṣadaḳa is dealt with in many ḥadīt̲h̲ (most easily accessible in ʿAlī al-Muttaḳī al-Hindī, Kanz al-ʿummāl , ed. Ḥayyānī and al-Saḳḳā, Aleppo 1391/1971, vi). Although ṣadaḳa is sometimes used for voluntary alms in explicit contrast to zakāt , its use in the sense of zakāt (found also in papyri (G. Khan, Selected Arabic \n papyri , Oxford 1992, i, 53)) remains frequent, with the result that in the classical collections of traditions, the ḥadīt̲h̲ dealing with voluntary almsgiving are often found in the chapters on zakāt . Mālik’s\n Muwaṭṭāʾ , however, already has in addition a separate section on voluntary almsgiving (in the recension of Yaḥyā b. Yaḥyā al-Maṣmūdī, ed. Muḥammad Fuʾād ʿAbd al-Bāḳī, Cairo n.d., 615-18). In the interpretation of neither the ḥadīt̲h̲ nor the Ḳurʾān was agreement reached as to which sense of ṣadaḳa was to be presumed as intended in the absence of further evidence.",
    "Beyond the ambiguity occasioned by the continued use of ṣadaḳa for zakāt , there is further uncertainty in the interpretation of some traditions created by the not infrequent use of ṣadaḳa in the sense of permanent alms ( ṣadaḳa d̲j̲āriya ), i.e. the trust or wakf [ q.v. ] (on this use in papyri, see R.G. Khoury, Chrestomathie de \n papyrologie arabe , Leiden 1993, 132-3 (Christian). Some even claimed that ṣadaḳa was used in the ḥadīt̲h̲ in the sense of the poll tax ( d̲j̲izya ) [ q.v. ], a usage others rejected as confined to the Tag̲h̲lib and other Christian Arab tribes ( ʿUmdat al-ḳārī , ix, 4-5).",
    "The references to ṣadaḳa in the ḥadīt̲h̲ are often of a homiletic character, stressing the excellence of alms given under one or another circumstance, whether that of the giver, the recipient, the time and place of the giving, or the gift (cf. al-Ḏj̲azāʾirī, Ḳalāʾid , i, 309). Thus when asked what ṣadaḳa was best, the Prophet is reported to have answered: \"the ṣadaḳa you give when \n ¶ you are still healthy and tight-fisted, fearing poverty and hoping for wealth ( S̲h̲arḥ al-sunna , vi, 172-3; al-Tibrīzī, Mis̲h̲kāt al-maṣābīḥ , tr. J. Robson, Lahore 1975, i, 395 (cf. Ḳurʾān, LXIII, 10)). The merit of almsgiving thus lies in the degree of self-denial ( mud̲j̲āhadat al-nafs ) ( Itḥāf al-sāda , iv, 168) a point made more explicitly in the tradition that states that the best ṣadaḳa is that which the person with little can manage to give ( d̲j̲uhd al-muḳill ) (Wensinck, Handbook , 20; Mis̲h̲kāt , i, 411 (cf. Ḳurʾān, IX, 79)). Because it is not the monetary value of what of what is given that is paramount, ṣadaḳa consisting of a dirham that constitutes half the almsgiver’s property is more meritorious than 100,000 dirhams given by a person of great wealth (al-Nasāʾī, Sunan , Cairo 1383/1964, v, 44; ʿAlī al-Ḳārī, S̲h̲arḥ ʿayn al-ʿilm , Cairo, i, 157). Alms given to a nearer neighbour is better than that given to one more distant. Giving alms to a relative is particularly meritorious, since one earns the rewards both for ṣadaḳa and for cultivating family ties. The reward for ṣadaḳa given on Friday is double that on other days of the week. Other traditions identify the best ṣadaḳa as that given in Ramaḍān. The reward for giving voluntary alms in secret is seventy times that of giving it publicly (al-Bayḍāwī, Anwār al-tanzīl , i, 138, on II, 271; ʿUmdat al-ḳārī , viii, 284). The place in which alms are given is also significant to its merit. A dirham given in Mecca, according to a S̲h̲īʿī tradition, merits a hundred-thousandfold reward, in Medina ten-thousandfold, in Kūfa one-thousandfold. \"Whoever gives one dirham of ṣadaḳa in Jerusalem ( Bayt al-Maḳdis ) gains his ransom from hellfire, and whoever gives a loaf of bread there is like one who has given [the weight of] of the earth’s mountains in gold\" (al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī). Of all that might be given as alms, water is pronounced to be best, and one who gives water to a thirsty Muslim will drink of the wine of Paradise.",
    "The importance of giving ṣadaḳa to avert tribulations in this life and to avoid the punishment of hellfire in the hereafter is the topic of many ḥadīt̲h̲s . \"Whoever can protect himself against hellfire should do so, even if it should be with half a date\". An angel is said to pray that the almsgiver be rewarded, while another angel prays for the destruction of the property of the one who withholds alms. Angels in the form of beggars sometimes come to test a family (al-Ḳādī al-Nuʿmān, Daʿāʾim al-Islām , ed. Fayḍī, Cairo 1389/1969, ii, 333), and it was Jacob’s failure to give alms to an unrecognised prophet in the guise of a beggar that led to the tragedy of Joseph ( ibid ., ii, 333-4). Where one has nothing tangible to give, one can still utter a kindly word (cf. Talmud Bavā Bat̲h̲rā 9b). Conduct meriting a reward is in fact frequently termed ṣadaḳa in the ḥadīt̲h̲ . Thus a man’s lawful sexual intercourse is ṣadaḳa , as is giving assistance with the loading of a beast, and every step take toward prayer. Planting something from which a person, bird or animal later eats counts as ṣadaḳa. One who supports himself and his family is credited with ṣadaḳa (with proper intention; cf. Ket̲h̲ubbōt̲h̲ , 50a). In this extended sense, corresponding to a large degree with the Jewish gemīlūt̲h̲ ḥasadīm , \"acts of loving kindness\" (G.F. Moore, Judaism , Cambridge, Mass. 1927, ii, 171-4), even greeting another with a cheerful face is deemed ṣadaḳa (cf. Avōt̲h̲ de-Rabbī Nathan , xiii, 4). In short, every good deed is ṣadaḳa ( kullu maʿrūfin ṣadaḳa ). Not even affirmative action is required, for a Muslim whose property is stolen is credited with having given it as ṣadaḳa.",
    "The continuity of Islamic teaching on ṣadaḳa with certain Jewish and Christian conceptions of almsgiving \n ¶ is evidenced by more than one tradition. \"Alms averts a bad death ( mītat al-sūʾ )” ( Kanz al-ʿummāl , vi, 345, in many versions etc.; maṣāriʿ al-sūʾ , Kanz al-ʿummāl , vi, 406) reproduces Proverbs, x, 2, \"righteousness ( ṣ e daḳa ) delivers from death,\" understood in the Talmud ( Bavā Bat̲h̲rā 10a) to refer to almsgiving delivering one from an unnatural death ( mīt̲h̲ā mes̲h̲unnā ; cf. Targum ad loc. mōt̲h̲ā bīs̲h̲ā ). The depiction of the giver of alms as dressed in an expanding coat of mail is reminiscent of Isa., lix, 17, \"He put on righteousness ( ṣ \n \n e \n \n daḳa ) as a breastplate\" which is taken in the Talmud ( Bavā Bat̲h̲rā 9b) as comparing the assembly of a coat of armour, chain by chain, with the growth of small acts of almsgiving to a considerable sum. Several ḥadīt̲h̲ s which stress the merit of secret almsgiving have exact Biblical parallels. \" Ṣadaḳa in secret extinguishes the wrath of the Lord\" renders Proverbs, xxi, 14, \"a gift given in secret soothes anger\" as interpreted in Bavā Bat̲h̲rā 9b. Christ’s exhortation \"do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing so that your giving may be in secret\" (Matt., vi, 3, 4) appears at the teaching of Muḥammad in several traditions (Wensinck, Handbook , 20; Mis̲h̲kāt , i, 407; noted by Goldziher, Muh . St ., ii, 384, and L. S̲h̲ayk̲h̲ū, al-Naṣrāniyya wa ādābuhā bayna ʿarab al-d̲j̲āhiliyya , Beirut 1923, ii/2, 319).",
    "The model for generosity in almsgiving is provided by the Prophet Muḥammad, who is described in the ḥadīt̲h̲ as \"the most generous of men, bestowing more good than the loosed wind\". He made it a point to give with his own hand and derived more joy from giving than the poor to whom he gave. When asked for anything, he never said no. If he had nothing to give, he remained silent (to elicit others to speak on behalf of the beggar). He is said never to have delivered a sermon without mentioning ṣadaḳa .",
    "The Prophet’s wives were also known for their almsgiving, notably Zaynab bint Ḏj̲aḥs̲h̲, the \"longest in arm\" ( ʿUmdat al-ḳārī , viii, 282-3, others apply the tradition to Sawda), Zaynab bint Ḵh̲uzayma al-Hilāliyya, already known before Islam as the \"mother of the poor\" ( umm al-masākīn ) for her almsgiving, and ʿĀʾisha (al-G̲h̲azālī. Iḥyāʾ ʿulūm al-dīn , Cairo 1387/1967, i, 298), who insisted on returning any blessing bestowed upon her by those she had assisted with alms, thus setting an example of purity of motive ( ik̲h̲lāṣ ) in giving. Extraordinary generosity was exhibited by ʿUmar b. al-Ḵh̲aṭṭāb. who, when the Prophet urged the giving of ṣadaḳa , hastened to give away half of what he owned, only to find that once again he was bested by Abū Bakr, who had given away all that he had. Another Companion, Abū Ḏh̲arr al-G̲h̲ifārī [ q.v. ], popular among modern Muslims (M. Rodinson, Islam and capitalism , New York 1973, 25), is said to have regarded the best ṣadaḳa as the most unsparing. Abū Ḏh̲arr was exiled by the caliph ʿUt̲h̲mān upon the complaint of Muʿāwiya, then governor of Syria, for his controversial view that zakāt had not abrogated all other forms of obligatory ṣadaḳa and that the Ḳurʾānic condemnation of \"those who hoard gold and silver and do not expend it in the way of God\" (IX, 34) was not averted by the payment of zakāt .",
    "According to the ḥadīt̲h̲ , the Prophet, himself so generous in giving ṣadaḳa , was scrupulous in not taking it, while accepting gifts intended as tokens of esteem ( hadiyya ) (cf. Ibn al-ʿArabī, Aḥkām al-Ḳurʾān , iii, 1449-50). It is agreed that the Prophet was prohibited from receiving zakāt , which, by cleansing the property and persons of those who pay it, acquires a taint of impurity, but opinions differ as to why the Prophet would not accept voluntary ṣadaḳa. \n Most, including \n ¶ \n Abū Ḥanīfa, Abū Yūsuf and Muḥammad al-S̲h̲aybānī, held that he was prohibited from taking it. Among the explanations offered for this prohibition are the indignity, inconsistent with the prophetic office, of accepting alms, the appearance of self-interest ( tuhma ) were the Prophet to accept ṣadaḳa while urging others to give it, and the meritoriousness of the Prophet’s special deprivation. A minority of scholars, including al-S̲h̲āfiʿī ( al-Umm , Cairo 1321-5, iii, 279), entertained the possibility that the Prophet was permitted to accept ṣadaḳa but refrained from doing so out of pious scruple. On either view, the Prophet would be free to use amenities, such as wells, dedicated to the use of public at large. The Prophet’s declining to accept the ṣadaḳa is deemed to be one of the signs of his prophethood ( dalāʾil al-nubuwwa ), the recognition of which led Salmān al-Fārisī [ q.v. ] to embrace Islam. There is disagreement whether or not it constitutes a proof for other prophets as well.",
    "Also characteristic of the Prophet, according to the majority of Muslims, but not Imāmī or Ismāʿīlī S̲h̲īʿīs, is that upon his death he left nothing to his heirs, all his property being ṣadaḳa , used here in a sense that includes the waḳf of his real property (Wensinck, Handbook , 162; cf. I. Hrbek, Muḥammads Nachlass \n und die \n Aliden , in \n ArO , xviii/3 [1950], 145-6). Here, too, the avoidance of an appearance of self-interest is cited in explanation ( ʿUmdat al-ḳārī , xxiii, 232). According to most authorities, all other prophets were like Muḥammad in leaving no estate for their heirs, but al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī argued on the basis of Ḳurʾān, XIX, 6, and XXVII, 16, that other prophets had left estates, and certain Baṣrans, including Ibn ʿUlayya (d. 218/833), understood the fact of Muhammad’s having left no estate to represent one of the personal distinctions ( faḍīla ) granted him, rather than an incident of the prophetic office as such.",
    "3. Ṣadaḳa in \n Islamic \n law . In addition to using ṣadaḳa for voluntary alms, Muslim jurists continue to use the word in a number of other meanings. As in the Ḳurʾān and ḥadīt̲h̲ , ṣadaḳa and zakāt are often used interchangeably for obligatory alms in legal literature, with which should be included the editorial matter of the ḥadīt̲h̲ collections (cf. the occasional doubling usage al-zakāt wa ’l-ṣadaḳāt in al-Ḳāḍī al-Nuʿmān, Daʿāʾim al-Islām , i , 251 and Taʾwīl al-daʿāʾim , ed. al-Aʿẓamī, Cairo, ii, 124, 128). However, against the view that saw them as entirely equivalent (e.g. al-Māwardī, al-Aḥkām al-sulṭāniyya , Cairo 1386/1966, 113), others attempted to draw a distinction based on Ḳurʾānic usage between zakāt , which is to be given to the authorities ( ītāʾ al-zakāt ), and ṣadaḳa , which the authorities are directed to take (Ḳurʾān, IX, 103). On this view, which corresponds to the distinction between ẓāhir and ḅātin property [see \n zakāt\n ], ṣadaḳa is applicable to lifestock and crops, while zakāt , a special kind of ṣadaḳa , applies to such personal property ( amwāl ) as gold and silver. This usage, identified as that of certain Ḥanafīs, has left its traces, and a preference for using ṣadaḳa to refer to the tax on livestock can be noted elsewhere as well (e.g. Mālik, al-Muwaṭṭaʾ , 167-87). Although ṣadaḳa continues to be used for waḳf , an effort to reduce ambiguity can be observed in such expressions as al-ṣadaḳāt al-mawḳūfāt , al-ṣadaḳāt al-muḥarramāt ( al-Umm , iii, 280-1), al-ṣadaḳāt al-musabbala (Ibn Muẓaffar, K. al-Bayān al-s̲h̲āfī , Ṣanʿāʾ 1404/1984, i, 533 (Zaydī), and ṣadaḳa muʾabbada (Ibn al-Muṭahhar al-Ḥillī, Īḍāḥ al-fawāʾid , ed. al-Kirmanī, Ḳumm 1388, ii, 378). The use of ṣadaḳa to refer to expiatory penalties is also found (al-Tahānawī, K. Kas̲h̲s̲h̲āf iṣṭilāḥāt al-funūn , Calcutta 1862, i, 851).",
    "Ṣadaḳa as a distinct juristic institution only partially \n ¶ reflects the various forms of charitable giving known to Islam. For the jurist, ṣadaḳa falls under the general heading of charitable gifts ( birr ) or gratuitous transfers, tabarruʿāt . More specifically, it is treated as a species of gift, hiba \"in the wider sense\" ( bi ’l-maʿnā al-aʿamm ), that is, a gratuitous transfer of tangible property (also ʿaṭiyya ). It is distinguished from other species of gift by the intention with which it is given, which must be to please God ( li-wad̲j̲h Allāh ) in the hope of a reward in the hereafter ( t̲h̲awāb al-āk̲h̲ira (al-Sanʿānī..., Beirut 1405/1985. Subul al-salām , ii, 196) and not for any wordly purpose such as to acquire a gift from the donee, which would render it an ordinary gift (also termed hiba ) or to honour the donee ( hadiyya ). It must, that is, constitute a ḳurba , an act performed as a means of coming closer to God. The significance of the donor’s intention is evidenced by the Prophet’s acceptance of gifts as hadiyya but not ṣadaḳa , a distinction also found in the form of an explicit prophetic tradition and reflected in the classification of gifts attributed to ʿAlī. Gifts of usufruct ( manfaʿa ) are by definition excluded from ṣadaḳa , and fall under the headings of license to consume ( ibāḥa , ḍiyāfa ), loan ( ʿāriya ) or trust ( waḳf ). The extent to which ṣadaḳa is separately treated in legal works varies from text to text, and even in those cases where there is a separate discussion of ṣadaḳa , some of the rules governing it are to be found in the chapters on gifts and zakāt , although it is not to be regarded as a recommended ( sunna ) form of zakāt (recommended zakāt is, however, known to Imāmī law, Abū Ḏj̲aʿfar al-Ṭūsī, al-Nihāya , Beirut 1390/1970, 176).",
    "Islamic law, by way of the ḥadīt̲h̲ , has preserved only a few of the distinct forms of gift giving known to the Arabs, e.g. the minḥa or manīḥa , said to be the best kind of ṣadaḳa. \n With Islam there came a radically simpler set of distinctions (even the difference between hiba and hadiyya is a terminological innovation), in which ṣadaḳa , defined by its religious intention, held a special place. Not surprisingly there was a discernible tendency for those giving gifts to prefer the label ṣadaḳa , with its connotation of a pious motive, for their transactions, sometimes to the consternation of jurists and with consequences, such as irrevocability, that the donors may not have contemplated. Thus in several S̲h̲īʿī traditions Ḏj̲aʿfar al-Ṣādiḳ is reported to have complained of an erroneous extension, unknown in the Prophet’s day, of the term ṣadaḳa to ordinary gifts (al-Baḥrānī, al-Ḥadāʾiḳ al-nāḍira , ed. al-Irwānī, Beirut 1405/1985, xxii, 262-5; al-Kulaynī, al-Kāfī , ed. al-G̲h̲affārī, Tehran 1388-91, vii, 31; al-Ṭūsī, al-Istibṣār , ed. al-Ḵh̲arsān, Tehran 1390, iv, 110; but cf. al-Ṭaḥāwī, S̲h̲arḥ maʿānī al-āt̲h̲ār , ii, 3-4 ( hiba labelled ṣadaḳa in the Prophet’s time).",
    "While the giving of ordinary gifts is recommended ( mandūb ilayhi ), to give ṣadaḳa is especially recommended, and, on the basis of the many Ḳurʾānic verses and traditions enjoining it, is classified by later S̲h̲āfiʿīs as \"strongly recommended\" ( sunna \n muʾakkada ). Under certain circumstances, however, it may be prohibited to give ṣadaḳa , as for instance, when doing so would prejudice discharging one’s obligation to support family members or pay off creditors, or when the giver knows or suspects that the ṣadaḳa will be used for an illegal purpose ( maʿṣiya ).",
    "Even in such cases, however, the preferred view is that the donee acquires a good title. It is debated to what extent ṣadaḳa to a person in dire need is to be deemed obligatory. It is recommended that the gift of ṣadaḳa be accompanied by a supplication to God for its acceptance.",
    "The rules governing the enforceability of the contract \n ¶ ( ʿaḳd ) of ṣadaḳa are essentially the same as those governing an ordinary gift, including the full legal capacity of the donor to enter into gratuitous transactions and the limitation on death-bed transactions [see \n hiba\n ]. However, some relaxation of the rules of gifts in their application to ṣadaḳa is occasionally to be noted. Thus most S̲h̲āfiʿīs in the case of ṣadaḳa dispense with the offer and acceptance ( al-īd̲j̲ābwa ’l-ḳabūl ) required by them for the validity of a gift. Although most jurists regard the taking of possession ( ḳabḍ , iḥrāz ) as just as essential to the enforceability of ṣadaḳa as of gifts, Isḥāḳ b. Rāhawayh made an exception of ṣadaḳa , as did al-S̲h̲āfiʿī for a time, and this is also reported of a number of early jurists (al-Sarak̲h̲sī, al-Mabsūṭ , Cairo 1324-31, xii, 48). The Mālikīs, starting from the enforceability in principle of an agreement to make a gift (possession being required to perfect the rights of the donee), go furthest in this direction. The declaration of a firm present intention, or indeed the present intention alone ( al-tabtīl bi ’l-niyya ), to give a particular person ṣadaḳa , according to the accepted ( mas̲h̲hūr ) teaching of Mālik, is enforceable against the donor, so that ṣadaḳa , like ṣ e daḳa in Jewish law (cf. Maimonides, Mis̲h̲ne Torā , Hilk̲h̲ōt̲h̲ Mattenōt̲h̲ ʿAniyyim , 8:1), is to this extent analysed as in the nature of a vow, rather than a contract. Along similar lines, ṣadaḳa intended for a particular person who cannot be found, according to some early authorities, including al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī, must be given as ṣadaḳa to another (cf. Talmud ʿArak̲h̲īm 6a).",
    "There is disagreement as to what extent the donor of ṣadaḳa can bind the donee by conditions attached to the gift. The S̲h̲āfiʿīs give effect to such conditions and hold that it is prohibited for the donee to use the ṣadaḳa otherwise than according to the terms of the gift. Ḥanafī, Ḥanbalī, Ẓāhirī, Twelver S̲h̲īʿī and Zaydī teaching, to the contrary, invalidates all terms and conditions inconsistent with an outright gift of the ṣadaḳa property (on the different Mālikī views, see al-Ḥattāb, Mawāhib al-d̲j̲alīl , Cairo 1329, vi, 50-1).",
    "A vow ( nad̲h̲r ) to give ṣadaḳa is discouraged, since the maker of the vow may never discharge it or may do so grudgingly. A vow to give ṣadaḳa may be discharged before the time originally stated, and a vow to give a specific thing as ṣadaḳa may be discharged by giving its value. A vow to give ṣadaḳa to the wealthy is said to be invalid. Disagreement is reported as to the judicial enforceability of a vow such as \"If I have sexual intercourse with my slave-girl, she is yours as ṣadaḳa ,\" said by a husband to his wife, where the intention is clearly not charitable ( nad̲h̲r al-lad̲j̲ād̲j̲ ).",
    "Unlike zakāt , in which the nature and value of the property due is fixed by law ( muḳaddar ), the giver of ṣadaḳa is free to determine what and how much he will give. The traditions encouraging the giving of even such trivial things as half a date as ṣadaḳa indicate that the object of ṣadaḳa , unlike an ordinary gift, need have no market value. It is, however, more meritorious to give ṣadaḳa from one’s best property, the giving of property that is adulterated or of poor quality being regarded as reprehensible ( makrūh ), and the giving of unlawful ( ḥarām ) property prohibited. Nonetheless, ṣadaḳa has functioned as a means of dealing with unsaleable merchandise (Ibn Farḥūn, Tabṣirat al-ḥukkām , on the margin of ʿUlays̲h̲. Fatḥ al-ʿalī al-mālik , Cairo, ii, 298 (adulterated milk and other substances; badly woven mantles to be shredded as rags for ṣadaḳa rather than burned) and the proceeds of illegal transactions (Ibn Hubayra, al-Ifṣāḥ , ed. al-Dabbās, Aleppo 1366/1947, 229 (a sale of grapes for winemaking); Subul al-salām iii, 14 (a prostitute’s earnings); Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr, al-Tamhīd , repr. Lahore 1404/1983, ii, \n ¶ 23-4 (misappropriated booty); cf. Ibn Mufliḥ, K. al-Furūʿ , ed. Farrād̲j̲, Beirut 1388/1967, ii, 663-6 (difficult cases)). The solution of the Ṣūfī al-Fuḍayl b. ʿIyāḍ (d. 187/803), who simply threw away questionable money that had come into his hands, was regarded as unsatisfactory ( Iḥyāʾ , ii, 166-8). In modern times, Muslims receiving payments of bank interest and insurance proceeds have been encouraged to rid themselves of these by giving them as ṣadaḳa (e.g. Dār al-Iftāʾ al-Miṣrī, al-Fatāwā al-islāmiyya , ix/28 [1403/1983], 3340, 3342).",
    "Just as there is no minimum for ṣadaḳa , according to most jurists there is no maximum (al-Nawawī, S̲h̲arḥ Muslim , Cairo, vii, 125 quoting Ḳāḍī ʿIyāḍ; but cf. Ibn Ḥazm, al-Muḥallā , ix, 138 for a list of early jurists who rejected this). A Muslim of sound mind and body who is able to accept poverty is encouraged to dispose of all his property as ṣadaḳa , beyond narrow exemptions. Although there are Ḳurʾānic verses (VI, 41, XVII, 26, 29) and traditions calling for moderation in giving, other verses (II, 262, IX, 79, LIX, 9) and traditions set no such limit, and it was to these as well as to the practice of early Muslims, not to speak of the Prophet, that the majority of jurists looked. The tradition stating that the best ṣadaḳa was that which left a sufficiency ( ʿan ẓahr g̲h̲inā ), which the Ẓāhirī Ibn Ḥazm took as the only criterion for how much one might give ( al-Muḥallā , ix, 136-42) was widely interpreted to mean \"self sufficiency\" ( g̲h̲inā al-nafs ), i.e. contentment. It is thus permitted to reduce oneself and one’s family to penury if those affected are capable of enduring it without becoming a burden on society and without complaint; otherwise it is reprehensible to give away all of one’s property, and subsequently to regret one’s ṣadaḳa deprives it of its reward.",
    "A minority of jurists set down specific limits on how much one might properly give: one-half, more commonly one-third, the proportion set down by Mālik, the Syrian jurists Makḥūl (d. 112/730) and al-Awzāʿī (d. 157/774), and the Zaydī Imām al-Hādī (d. 298/911) and recommended by al-Ṭabarī (d. 310/923), or one-fifth, one-seventh, or one-tenth (depending on wealth, attributed to Ḏj̲ābir b. Zayd (d. 93/712) (cf. one-fifth in Talmud Ket̲h̲ubbōt̲h̲ 50a).",
    "Unlike zakāt , which is designated for specified classes of recipients, there are virtually no restrictions on those to whom ṣadaḳa may be given, and the giver is encouraged not to restrict his giving to one group, although the law, following the ḥadīt̲h̲ , does identify preferred donees such as relatives and neighbours (al-Nawawī, al-Mad̲j̲mūʿ , Cairo, vi, 260: consensus that relatives are preferred to strangers). A mosque or other institution can be a recipient of ṣadaḳa , which is accepted on its behalf by its representative, who can be the donor himself.",
    "Most jurists understand the prohibition against the receipt of ṣadaḳa by members of the family ( āl ) of Muḥammad (as variously defined) to apply only to obligatory ṣadaḳa , that is, zakāt , although the matter was much controverted, with Abū Ḥanīfa, Abū Yūsuf, and Muḥammad al-S̲h̲aybānī and Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal reported as having prohibited voluntary ṣadaḳa to them as well, which was also the view of Zayd b. ʿAlī, Ibn Ḥazm and a number of later jurists.",
    "Although in popular usage ṣadaḳa was understood to refer to gifts to the poor, as may be gathered from lexicographical works, both general ( LA , s.v. ṣadaḳa ) and juridical (al-Nawawī, Tahd̲h̲īb al-asmāʾ wa ’l-lug̲h̲āt , Cairo n.d., repr. Tehran, ii, 197, s.v. hiba ; idem, Taṣḥīḥ al-tarbih , 93, s.v. hiba ), the teaching of the jurists is unanimous that ṣadaḳa , unlike zakāt and the Jewish \n ¶ \n ṣedaḳa , may be given to the \"wealthy\" ( g̲h̲anī ) (as defined for zakāt or zakāt al-fiṭra ). Traditions such as \"give to one who asks even if he is mounted on a horse\" ( al-Muwaṭṭaʾ , 615), the practice of the early Muslims, and Ḳurʾān, XII, 88, are all cited in support of this doctrine. Nonetheless, the reward for giving to the needy is said to be seventy times that of giving to one not in need, and the greater merit (eighteenfold), according to a tradition, of making a loan as compared to giving ṣadaḳa (tenfold) is explained by the evident need of the borrower (cf. Talmud S̲h̲abbat̲h̲ 63a, and Ras̲h̲i, ad loc .). In this spirit, the S̲h̲āfiʿī jurists distinguish between ṣadaḳa to the poor, which requires no intention of a heavenly reward on the part of the donor, and ṣadaḳa to the wealthy, which does.",
    "A point of departure for a thorough-going distinction between ṣadaḳa to the poor and to the wealthy is found in the Ḥanafī tradition. Abū Ḥanīfa, who did not recognise the validity of gifts of an undivided share, did uphold a gift in the form of ṣadaḳa or hiba to two poor persons but not to two wealthy persons (al-S̲h̲aybānī, al-Ḏj̲āmiʿ al-ṣag̲h̲īr , Karachi 1407/1987, 356). In the former case, it was explained, the poor donees represented the actual single recipient, God. Certain Ḥanafīs are reported to have generalised this teaching and to have recognised as ṣadaḳa only gifts to the poor, whether designated by the donor as ṣadaḳa or hiba , since the intention of giving to the poor can only be to gain a heavenly reward, unlike gifts to the wealthy, where a wordly motive is imputed, even when they are designated as ṣadaḳa (al-Sarak̲h̲sī, al-Mabsūṭ , xii, 92).",
    "Ṣadaḳa , unlike zakāt , may be given to non-Muslims. The earlier prohibition, or popular sentiment of the early Muslims, against doing so is understood to have been abrogated by Ḳurʾān, II, 272, and the Prophet frequently gave ṣadaḳa to non-Muslims to bring them closer to Islam (Abu ’l-Hudā al-Ṣayyādī, Ḍawʾ al-s̲h̲ams , 1394/1974, ii, 94). The validity of such ṣadaḳa applies in the first instance to d̲h̲immīs , Jews, Christians and Magians, but according to some jurists ṣadaḳa may also be given to enemy aliens ( ḥarbī ) who are related or allied to the Muslims or who are being held as prisoners or whose conversion is hoped for. Such ṣadaḳa is deemed meritorious. Non-Muslims are not, however, to be given portions of sacrificial animals ( uḍḥiyya ). Some S̲h̲īʿī jurists opposed giving ṣadaḳa to any non-Muslims or at least argued that ṣadaḳa to non-Muslims be given only in cases of need and only to the extent of that need, and there are Imāmī traditions that oppose the giving of ṣadaḳa to Sunnīs and Zaydīs.",
    "The chief practical difference between ṣadaḳa and an ordinary gift lies in the almost universal recognition that a gift in the form of ṣadaḳa is not subject to revocation ( rud̲j̲ūʿ , irtid̲j̲āʿ , iʿtiṣār ). While the jurists differ in the degree to which they recognise the revocability, however much disapproved, of ordinary gifts, they agree that ṣadaḳa is in principle irrevocable, although the Ḥanafīs regard the irrevocability of ṣadaḳa to a wealthy person, which they uphold, as contrary to strict legal reasoning ( istiḥsān ). Mālikī doctrine departs from this principle to the extent of upholding an express right of revocation reserved by a father or mother in a gift of ṣadaḳa to their children, a rule extended by some Mālikīs to ṣadaḳa between strangers, rendering the gift inalienable during the lifetime of the donor, and both al-S̲h̲āfiʿī and Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal are reported to have held that a father has a right to revoke ṣadaḳa to his child. The view of the Imāmī Abū Ḏj̲aʿfar al-Ṭūsī (d. 459/1067) ( al-Mabsūṭ , iii, 314) that ṣadaḳa and ordinary gifts were legally indistinguishable, \n ¶ even as regards revocability, was regarded as exceptional, and it was, in fact, argued by others that ṣadaḳa , being irrevocable, should not be classified as a species of gift (al-Tahānawī, Kas̲h̲s̲h̲āf , ii, 1449).",
    "Various explanations are offered for the irrevocability of ṣadaḳa. One is that the donor’s heavenly reward for ṣadaḳa provides moral consideration for the gift, and gifts for which consideration has been given are irrevocable. This explanation, characteristic of the Ḥanafīs (al-Sarak̲h̲sī, al-Mabsūṭ , xii, 58), for whom it is part of a general theory of irrevocability, is cited by others as well, but is open to criticism. It is also suggested that ṣadaḳa is irrevocable inasmuch as is given in the first instance to God, the obligation to whom is discharged by delivery to the poor person (al-Sarak̲h̲sī, al-Mabsūṭ , xii, 58; cf. al-Zurḳānī, S̲h̲arḥ al-Muwaṭṭaʾ , iv, 47 (irrevocable because for the sake of God)). Where the nature of the gift is disputed, the donee resisting revocation has the burden of proving that it is ṣadaḳa. \n Significantly, the rule of irrevocability was applied to gifts to the poor which were designated by their donors as ordinary gifts and not ṣadaḳa , but which were treated by the jurists, who looked to the substance, not the form, of the transaction, as within the scope of ṣadaḳa.",
    "Closely related to the question of the irrevocability of ṣadaḳa was that of the re-acquisition of property given as ṣadaḳa. In a tradition the Prophet is reported to have told ʿUmar not to purchase a horse that he had previously given as ṣadaḳa and to have compared the person who goes back to his ṣadaḳa to a dog that returns to its vomit. For most jurists, re-acquisition by a voluntary act of the donor, such as purchase, gift or ṣadaḳa , is disapproved, but not passive re-acquisition by inheritance or a wife’s re-acquisition as support of what she gave her husband as ṣadaḳa. \n For the Mālikīs, but not the S̲h̲āfiʿīs, the disapproval of re-acquisition extends to cases in which the property has passed through one or more intervening owners prior to its re-acquisition. A minority of jurists, including the Ẓāhirīs, regarded all instances of re-acquisition, even by inheritance, as prohibited. The disapproval of reacquisition extends to obligatory ṣadaḳa , that is zakāt , and property given as expiation ( kaffāra ) or in discharge of a vow ( nad̲h̲r ), and to the enjoyment of the usufruct of what has been given, but not to ṣadaḳa intended for the public such as water for a mosque. The rule against re-acquisition (at least by purchase) is variously explained. According to one explanation, the donee in selling the ṣadaḳa to the donor will not feel free to bargain at arms’ length, and the lower purchase price, coming as a consequence of the ṣadaḳa , will vitiate the original gift. A second explanation regards re-acquisition as compromising the \"form\" ( ṣūra ) of the ṣadaḳa , which requires completely divesting oneself of the gift. The Imāmī Muḥammad b. Idrīs al-Ḥillī (d. 598/1202) rejected the rules against re-acquisition as inconsistent with the donee’s full right of ownership ( K. al-Sarāʾir , Ḳumm 1410, iii, 174).",
    "The acceptance of ṣadaḳa is subject to its own rules. Most consider acceptance under ordinary circumstances to be a \"recommended\" ( sunna ) act, obligatory only when the recipient is in the most dire need ( muḍṭarr ), and in such cases, the reward for taking may well exceed that for giving. A minority, including Ibn Ḥazm, require that a gift of ṣadaḳa be accepted, if only to be at once returned to the giver ( al-Muḥallā , ix, 152-4).",
    "Apart from a limited number of exceptions, including that of utter want, begging is prohibited, and \n ¶ even then the poor are encouraged to accept their fate without soliciting alms (cf. Iḥyāʾ i, 298), the poor who do so being preferred as recipients of ṣadaḳa to beggars (cf. Ḳurʾān, II, 273). In any case, if one is able, it is better to earn one’s livelihood by the most menial tasks than to beg (to thus be able to give ṣadaḳa ). Begging has its own etiquette. Importunate begging, begging in a mosque, and begging in the name of God are all disapproved, although in the latter case, according to some, the beggar invoking God’s name should not be turned away empty-handed. It is forbidden for a person of sufficient means to beg as if in need and disapproved for him to put himself in the way of receiving alms. Otherwise, such a person may accept unsolicited alms.",
    "4. The practice of ṣadaḳa. The giving of ṣadaḳa was and remains widespread among Muslims, encouraged as it is by many Ḳurʾānic verses and traditions. These indicate that the giving of ṣadaḳa serves a number of distinct functions. Ṣadaḳa acts, in the first place, as expiation for sins, and it is recommended that it be given immediately following any transgression ( maʿṣiya ) ( Iḥyāʾ , i, 298, the advice of the legendary sage Luḳmān), for example, after intercourse with a menstruating woman. Voluntary almsgiving can thus make good shortcomings in the past payment of zakāt .",
    "Closely related to the expiatory function of ṣadaḳa is its special role in affording protection against all manner of evils. According to a tradition, the ṣadaḳa that a Muslim gives wards off afflictions in this world, questioning in the grave, and punishment on Judgement Day (Ismāʿīl Ḥaḳḳī, Tafsīr rūḥ al-bayān , Istanbul 1911-25, i, 418). Accordingly, it is recommended to give ṣadaḳa at the start of each day as insurance against personal troubles (cf. Ḳurʾān, II, 274). The constant giving of little is said to please God more than the occasional giving of much. Although giving ṣadaḳa is recommended at all times, it is especially appropriate to give it upon significant occasions such as going to war or on a journey, and the tradition stating that \"it is better for a man to give a dirham in alms while he is alive and healthy than one hundred dirhams when he is dying\" did not prevent al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī from teaching that \"the most appropriate time for a man to give ṣadaḳa is his last day in this world and his first in the next\" (al-ʿAbbās b. Aḥmad al-Ṣanʿānī, Tatimmat al-rawḍ al-naḍīr , with al-Rawḍ al-naḍīr , iv, 122-3).",
    "The positive side of giving ṣadaḳa lies in the merit that accrues to the giver, greater according to some than that of zakāt . Ṣadaḳa is encouraged as a means of bringing down sustenance ( rizḳ ) from heaven. The giver of ṣadaḳa is promised a reward many times what he has given, from ten times for ṣadaḳa given to a healthy person, ninety for a blind or handicapped person, nine hundred times for a needy relative, one hundred thousand for parents, and nine hundred thousand for a scholar.",
    "The merit of giving ṣadaḳa does not stop with the giver. \"Cure your sick with ṣadaḳa ,\" the Prophet is reported to have said. Nor is the benefit of ṣadaḳa limited to the living, for according to the ḥadīt̲h̲ , ṣadaḳa may be given in the name of deceased Muslims, especially by a child on behalf of a parent, and its reward will be presented to them on a platter of light ( ṭabaḳ min nūr ). Although the Muʿtazila are alleged to have denied the efficacy of alms in the name of the deceased, a consensus is claimed for it (al-Nawawī, S̲h̲arḥ Muslim , vii, 90; al-Zurkānī, S̲h̲arḥ al-Muwaṭṭaʾ , iv, 56). The deceased is credited with the merit of having given the ṣadaḳa , a reward that does not diminis̲h̲ that of the giver.",
    "In the giving of ṣadaḳa Muslims have found also a \n ¶ means of moral edification. According to the Mālikī jurist Ibn Rāshid al-Ḳafṣī (d. 736/1336), the rationale ( ḥikma ) of the law of gifts is to purify the soul from the malady of avarice ( buk̲h̲l ) ( K. Lubāb al-lubāb , Tunis 1346, 243), and ṣadaḳa embodies the virtue of generosity ( d̲j̲ūd , sak̲h̲āʾ ), a reflection of the generosity of God the \"All-Giving\" ( al-Wahhāb ). \"The believer is obligated to instruct his child in generosity and charity just as he is obligated to instruct him in monotheistic doctrine and belief, for the love of this world is the source of all sin,\" according to Abū Manṣūr al-Māturīdī (Ibn Nud̲j̲aym ..., Cairo 1334/1915, al-Baḥr al-rāʾik , vii, 284). The transformation of ṣadaḳa in the act of giving is depicted in a tradition in which ṣadaḳa , personified, addresses its giver: \"I was little and you made me much, I was small and you made me great, I was your enemy and you made me your friend, I was perishable and you made me permanent, I was guarded and you made me your guard.’’ On the other hand, the role of ṣadaḳa in the redistribution of wealth has tended to be neglected in the growing literature by modern Muslims on Islamic economics, which has understandably focused on zakāt (but cf. A. Qureshi, The economic and social system of Islam , Lahore 1979, 91-7).",
    "The Ḳurʾān urges believers not to undo their charitable gifts with \"obligation\" ( mann ) and \"insult\" ( ad̲h̲ā ). \"Kind speech and forgiveness,\" it teaches, \"are better than ṣadaḳa followed by insult\" (II, 263-4). The giver is forbidden to regard himself as having conferred a benefit on the taker, an attitude than can be exhibited in thought, word or conduct or to demean the taker in any fashion. Mann is deemed to be a grave sin ( kabīra ), although there is disagreement as to whether it entirely destroys the reward of the ṣadaḳa or merely diminishes it (on the Muʿtazilī teaching of the cancellation of good deeds by bad ( iḥbāṭ ), see M.J. McDermott, The theology of \n al-Shaykh al-Mufīd , Beirut 1978, 258-62). \"Obligation\" and \"insult\" can be avoided by giving one’s ṣadaḳa in secret. The Ḳurʾānic recommendation of \"kind speech\" is respected by the use of stereotyped replies in turning down the requests of beggars (see e.g. M. Piamenta, The Muslim \n conception of God and human welfare as reflected in everyday Arabic speech , Leiden 1983, 65-6; C.A. Nallino, L ’ Arabo \n parlato in \n Egitto , Milan 1939, repr. 1978, 134), although some early Muslims, like the Prophet, are reported to have preferred silence.",
    "5. Ṣadaḳa\n in \n Ṣūfism \n and \n S̲h̲īʿī \n esotericism . The giving and receiving of ṣadaḳa have a special place in Ṣūfism with its encouragement of self-imposed poverty. This had led Ṣūfīs to be distinguished as givers of ṣadaḳa and by virtue of their poverty as suitable recipients. There are reports of fabulous sums given away as ṣadaḳa by those seeking to elevate their spiritual state (Abū Naṣr al-Sarrād̲j̲, Kitāb al-Lumaʿ , ed. Nicholson, Leiden 1914, 158; Ibn al-Ḏj̲awzī, Talbīs Iblīs , ed. al-Munīr, Cairo, 170). Such Ṣūfīs could claim the Prophet and Abū Bakr as their models. In the light of the prophetic tradition that the \"upper hand [of the giver] is superior to the lower hand [of the recipient]\", pious givers of ṣadaḳa , unwilling to assume an attitude of superiority, resorted to such devices as putting their hand below that of the poor person ( Ihyāʾ , i, 286) or throwing the gift on the ground (al-Ḳus̲h̲ayrī, al-Risāla , Cairo, 114).",
    "Ṣūfīs differed in their attitudes toward the acceptance of ṣadaḳa. \n Some, not wishing to compete with the rest of the poor (being themselves spiritually wealthy) and to avoid being indebted to anyone other than God, studiously refrained from accepting ṣadaḳa. But Ibn Ḳutayba (d. 276/889) already critically notes a Ṣūfī interpretation that the upper hand in the prophetic \n ¶ tradition refers to the recipient ( Talbīs Iblīs , 179). In accepting ṣadaḳa the poor Ṣūfīs were actually conferring a benefit on the giver (al-Hud̲j̲wīrī, Kas̲h̲f al-maḥd̲j̲ūb , tr. Nicholson, Leiden 1914, 316-17 (rejecting the interpretation of the literalist ahl-i ḥas̲h̲w ; cf. Lev . Rabbā 34:8), and the Ḳurʾānic reference to God accepting ṣadaḳāt (IX, 104) and the tradition that the All-Merciful accepts ṣadaḳa in His right hand encouraged the view that the actual giver of ṣadaḳa was God ( Kas̲h̲f al-maḥd̲j̲ūb , 316-317; Ihyāʾ i, 285; anon., K. Adab al-mulūk fī bayān ḥaḳāʾiḳ al-taṣawwuf ed. Radtke, Beirut 1991, 41), a view said to have been cited by wealthy Ṣūfīs in justification of their abusive amassing of fortunes from alms ( Talbīs Iblīs , 179). Al-Ḏj̲unayd (d. 298/910 [ q.v. ]), who was among those who regarded it as better to take ṣadaḳa than zakāt ( Iḥyāʾ , i, 302), strongly approved the practice of preferring the poor Ṣūfīs as recipients. The humiliation of begging was, in addition, imposed by some Ṣūfī masters on their novices as a form of spiritual discipline.",
    "The influential Andalusian Ṣūfī Ibn ʿArabī (d. 638/1240) offered novel interpretations, at once paradoxical and harmonising, of ṣadaḳa. The superiority of voluntary alms to the obligatory zakāt is expounded on the basis of a metaphysical analysis of obligation ( Futūḥāt , i, 590-1), but from another point of view the superiority of zakāt is upheld ( ibid ., i, 587). The \"upper\" and \"lower\" hands of the tradition are both the \"hands\" of God, understood as different divine attributes bestowing mercy. The virtues of secret and public giving, properly understood, are such that both should be practiced (they are same for the gnostic or ʿārif ). But the high point of the influence of ṣadaḳa upon Ṣūfī thought probably came with his predecessor Abu ’l-ʿAbbās al-Sabtī (d. 601/1205), whose entire teaching revolved around ṣadaḳa , the other institutions of Islam and even the nature of existence being interpreted in its light (al-Tādilī, Ak̲h̲bār Abi ’l-ʿAbbās al-Sabtī , with his al-Tas̲h̲awwuf ilā rid̲j̲āl al-taṣawwuf , Rabat 1404/1984, 453-4; C. Addas, The quest for the red sulphur , Cambridge 1993, 176-7).",
    "The S̲h̲īʿī tradition of esoteric interpretation ( taʾwīl ) did not ignore ṣadaḳa. The giving of ṣadaḳa is taken as representative of the various forms of assistance that could be offered to the Imām of the Twelver S̲h̲īʿīs and his followers. The givers of ṣadaḳa mentioned in the Ḳurʾān are the Imāms, who bestow guidance. For the Fātimid Chief Justice al-Nuʿmān b. Muhammad (d. 363/957), voluntary ṣadaḳa symbolises the volunteered esoteric knowledge, in the form of admonition and exhortation, that those of higher ranks bestow on those below them ( Taʾwīl al-daʿāʾim , ii, 94, iii, 63)."
