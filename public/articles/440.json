    "( a. ), “repentance”, verbal noun of tāba , “to repent, return (sc. from one’s sins), be converted” to God (cf. Rabbinic teshuba ). The definitive teachings on repentance in Islam are found in the Ḳurʾān, the Ḥadīt̲h̲ , and in the literature of piety, especially of the Ṣūfī type. The root t-w-b occurs frequentiy in the Ḳurʾān, mostly in Medinan passages, with the forms tawba (“repentance”) and tawwāb (“oft-turning, relenting”, of God) being exclusively Medinan. Verbal forms (e.g. tāba , yatūbu ) often take ilā when referring to human repentance towards God; when God is the subject, ʿalā is used, as in II, 37 rabbuhu ... fa-tāba ʿalayhi innahu huwa al-tawwāb al-raḥīm (“his [sc. Adam’s] Lord turned towards him; for He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful”).",
    "The Ḳurʾān’s vocabulary of repentance is varied and nuanced. Two roots—almost exclusively of Meccan origin—are: ʾ-w-b , with the forms awwāb , “frequent in returning, or repenting” (e.g. L, 32), iyāb , “return” (e.g. LXXXVIII, 25), and maʾāb , “place of return” (e.g. XXXVIII, 55, where it means Hell as the final stop for sinners); and n-w-b , Form IV (with ilā ): as in munībīna ilayhi \n “[people] turning toward Him” in repentance (XXX, 31). A third, infrequent, repentance root is n-d-m , meaning “remorse, regret” for sin (for fear of punishment as much as a positive turning towards God), as in nadāma (XXXIV, 33) “repentance”; a second form is nādimīn (XLIX, 6) “[people] full of repentance” for harm inadvertently done to others. T-w-b dominated the Ḳurʾānic discourse on repentance by Medinan times, folding into itself the meanings contained in the terms just introduced. These other terms would later be used—especially by Ṣūfīs—in making distinctions within the semantic field of repentance. Hud̲j̲wīrī (d. 469/1077) asserts that “ tawbat is to return \n ¶ from great sins to obedience; inābat is to return from minor sins to love; and awbat is to return from one’s self to God” ( Kas̲h̲f , 295).",
    "The Ḥadīt̲h̲ contains a variety of teachings on repentance and, as in the Ḳurʾān, often links it with seeking God’s forgiveness ( istig̲h̲fār ). The Prophet declared (according to Abū Hurayra): “God is my witness, that I seek forgiveness of God and turn to Him ( atūbu ilayhi ) more than seventy times a day” (al-Buk̲h̲ārī). Ibn ʿUmar reported the Prophet as saying that: “God accepts the repentance ( tawba ) of a servant so long as the death rattle has not occurred ( mā lam yug̲h̲arg̲h̲ir )” (Ibn Mād̲j̲a). Anas reported that Muḥammad said: “All of Adam’s offspring are sinners, but the best of sinners are those given to repentance ( al-tawwābūn )” (al-Tirmid̲h̲ī).",
    "Repentance discourse was well developed by the 4th/10th century, when it was widely considered to be the first station ( maḳām ) on the Ṣūfī path. Hud̲j̲wīrī defines tawba as “(1) remorse for disobedience, (2) immediate abandonment of sin, and (3) determination not to sin again” ( Kas̲h̲f , 294). He adds that contrition ( nadāma ) “may be due to three causes: (1) fear of Divine chastisement and sorrow for evil actions, (2) desire of Divine favour and certainty that it cannot be gained by evil conduct and disobedience, (3) shame before God” ( ibid ., 295). Al-G̲h̲azālī (d. 505/1111) included a detailed chapter on tawba in his Iḥyāʾ , holding that repentance is a free act, obligatory on every Muslim as a life-long spiritual discipline.",
    "Early Ṣūfīs debated whether the sins of a true penitent should be remembered or forgotten. Hud̲j̲wīrī relates that Sahl al-Tustarī (d. 283/896 [ q.v. ]) held that “repentance consists in not forgetting your sins, but always regretting them ... so that you will not be pleased with yourself on that account... [because] one who never forgets his sins will never become conceited. Al-D̲j̲unayd (d. 297/910 [ q.v. ]) and others [argued that] . . . repentance consists in forgetting the sin.... for remembrance of sin is a veil between God and those who contemplate Him” (Hud̲j̲wīrī, op . cit ., 296)."
