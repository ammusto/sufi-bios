    "Ḥayra (Sufism), a technical term in Islamic mysticism meaning ‘perplexity’, ‘confusion’ or ‘bewilderment.’ Together with its associated noun taḥayyur , it means the experience of a state of amazement or confusion (al-Bayhaqī, 1/307, 2/825; Sajjādī, 331). In Islamic philosophy, the term ḥayra signifies an enduring state of doubt from which one cannot attain certainty or grasp a concept using rational proofs or arguments, and is therefore considered undesirable. In this sense, the concepts of ḥayra and intellect ( ʿaql ) are understood to be mutually contradictory (see Rūmī, 3/1987). Sufi discussions of ḥayra are more nuanced in this respect: for example, in one part of the Mathnawī , ḥayra is defined as a state of sudden bewilderment that occurs while the spiritual wayfarer is engaged in contemplation and thought (Rūmī, 1/311–313, 5/795; Gawharīn, 4/321; al-Sarrāj al-Ṭūsī, 421). Sometimes, ḥayra is described as ‘inflaming’ the intellect, so that in longing ardently and seeking the Beloved, the state of perplexity interrupts the wayfarer’s contemplation and reflection, and in so doing it prevents his heart from attaining the object of its desire (see Ḥāfiẓ, ode 64; al-Sarrāj al-Ṭūsī, 421; Gawharīn, 4/323; Baqlī, Sharḥ , 555–556).",
    "Sufis have identified two varieties of ḥayra : confusion concerning the question of God’s existence itself, and perplexity concerning His quality and modality of existence. The first kind of ḥayra means doubting God’s existence, which may lead to polytheism and error and is therefore condemned. The second kind of ḥayra is the result of the innate limitations of the intellect and the inability of the spiritual wayfarer to gain knowledge of God through rational deduction. In the Sufi worldview this stems from the fundamental inability of created things to fully comprehend their Creator and His immeasurable manifestations. Perplexity is corollary to the understanding in Sufism that the answer to every significant question about God and His Creation is ‘He/not He’ ( huwa lā huwa ). This parallels another Sufi maxim, that ‘none knows God but God’ (Chittick, Sufi Path , 4). According to Sufis, becoming perplexed is actually a form of mystical gnosis ( maʿrifa ); indeed it could be understood as the highest form of such knowledge, as per the adage attributed to the first caliph, Abū Bakr: ‘the incapacity to attain perception is itself perception’ (Chittick, Self-Disclosure of God , 64; see also Hujwīrī, 28, 401–403; Sārimī, 229; Anṣārī, 635; Najm al-Dīn, Marmūzāt , 47).",
    "From the viewpoint of certain mystics, mystical perplexity is understood as a level of knowledge ( ʿirfān ), perhaps even the highest level. Dhū al-Nūn al-Miṣrī (q.v., d. ca. 245/860) is credited with saying that perplexity is one of the stages of mystical gnosis ( maʿrifa ) and the very essence of gnosis (ʿAṭṭār, Tadhkira , 158; al-Kalābādhī, 137). Abū Bakr al-Wāsiṭī (d. ca. 320/923) describes it as one of the four stages of mystical ecstasy ( wajd ) (Suhrawardī, 527), while Farīd al-Dīn ʿAṭṭār (d. 617/1220, q.v.) recognises it as the sixth of the seven valleys of spiritual wayfaring ( Manṭiq al-ṭayr , 407–408).",
    "Early masters such as Bāyazīd Bisṭāmī (q.v.), Abū Saʿīd al-Kharrāz (q.v.), Sahl al-Tustarī and al-Shiblī, state that perplexity is the pinnacle of knowledge ( ʿirfān ) and that the person that knows God best is the one who is most perplexed about Him (Hujwīrī, 28, 401–403; ʿAṭṭār, Tadhkira , 151; Anṣārī, 190, 635; Baqlī, ʿAbhar , 119–120; Nwyia, 234). This is typically supported with reference to a tradition of the Prophet: ‘O God, increase my bewilderment in Thee!’ (Hujwīrī, 402; Sanāʾī, 63–64; Najm al-Dīn, Mirṣād , 326; idem, Marmūzāt , 47). Thus, unlike philosophers who seek to remove perplexity through rational demonstration, the mystic sees perplexity as a desirable condition. According to some writers, perplexity is the only way by which the human being can bring himself into the presence of God (Baqlī, ʿAbhar , 119–120; Rūmī, 3/1987).",
    "Ḥayra is considered to be higher than knowledge ( ʿirfān ) by some Sufis, who suggest that knowledge ( ʿilm ) and intellect can only bring the seeker to the shore of the ocean of annihilation ( fanāʾ ), beyond which there is only perplexity and unknowing (Sanāʾī, 63–64; Maybudī, 4/23; Pārsā, Qudsiyya , 182–183). This seems to lie behind Junayd al-Baghdādī’s remark that the path of the intellect in divine unity ( tawḥīd ) ends with perplexity: ‘those possessors of intellects who have arrived at its utmost realisation, have arrived at bewilderment’ (al-Qushayrī, 299, Epistle on Sufism , 308). According to ʿAṭṭār, in the valley of perplexity, heart and home disappear, and seekers become lost and wander aimlessly; they know nothing and are not even aware that they know nothing. Someone lost in this valley cannot distinguish between drunkenness and sobriety, existence and nothingness, the manifest and the hidden, annihilation and subsistence, or between belief and disbelief (ʿAṭṭār, Manṭiq , 407; al-Ḥallāj, Ṭawāsīn , 26–27, 32; Ṣārimī, 226).",
    "Ḥayra is sometimes considered as the opposite of knowledge ( ʿirfān ), and a condition with different phases or characteristics such as wonderment ( dahsha or dahash ) and awe ( buhta ). At the beginning of his state of perplexity, the seeker is aware of his state and existence, but as time passes, although still aware of his existence, he becomes immersed in the ocean of realities, and forgets his own state; this is wonderment. The final stage of perplexity is when the seeker becomes utterly unaware of even his own existence; this is awe (ʿAyn al-Quḍāt, Sharḥ , 177–178; Baqlī, Sharḥ , 320, 484, 556; Najm al-Dīn, Mirṣād , 326; al-Sarrāj al-Ṭūsī, 421; Ibn al-ʿArabī, al-Futūḥāt , 2/316, 3/154; Gawharīn, 4/321, 324). Perplexity represents an intermediate station between hope and despair in seeking one’s goal that overtakes the mystic’s heart, so that he does not despair utterly of his quest. Perplexity is not a purely negative or privative state of being; on the contrary, there are affirmative and real aspects to it, often accompanied by divine self-disclosure ( tajallī ), witnessing ( mushāhada ), manifestation of the truth, and proximity to God (Najm al-Dīn, Mirṣād , 326; Baqlī, Sharḥ , 487; al-Ḥallāj, Akhbār , 17; al-Hujwīrī, 155, 548; Ibn al-ʿArabī, al-Tajalliyāt , 262–263, 501–505; Kh w ārazmī, 729; Pārsā, Faṣl , 263). Al-Ḥakīm al-Tirmidhī (q.v.) identifies three stages of knowledge ( maʿrifa ): distraction and bewilderment ( walah wa taḥayyur ); pleasure ( ladhdha ); and annihilation and perplexity ( fanāʾ wa ḥayra ) (al-Ḥakīm al-Tirmidhī, 133–134; Nwyia, 234). Hujwīrī also associates perplexity with love (p. 547) as does Ibn al-ʿArabī ( al-Futūḥāt , 2/341), while others maintain that intense love ultimately leads to ḥayra (see Bahāʾ al-Dīn, 1/138; Baqlī, Sharḥ , 137; al-Kāshānī, ʿAbd al-Razzāq, Iṣṭilāḥāt , 355).",
    "Certain Sufis distinguish between two kinds of ḥayra : blameworthy ( madhmūm ) and praiseworthy ( mamdūḥ ). The blameworthy kind increases a seeker’s doubt, hesitation and indecision at the beginning of his spiritual journey, until it finally leads him astray into heedlessness ( ghafla ) and error ( ḍalāla ). On the other hand, praiseworthy perplexity is that which emanates from knowledge ( maʿrifa ), reflection ( tafakkur ) and contemplation ( taʾammul ) (al-Ḥallāj, Akhbār , 51; Pārsā, Faṣl , see also Kh w ārazmī, 729). Kh w ājah ʿAbd Allāh Anṣārī differentiates between these two forms of ḥayra by classifying them as ‘naïve perplexity’, meaning the kind that leads to disbelief and error, and ‘perplexity through vision’ ( ḥayrati ʿiyān ). On the other hand, Jāmī calls these the ‘perplexity of those who speculate’ ( ḥayrat-i nuẓẓār ) and ‘the perplexity of those with insight’ ( ḥayrat ūlū al-abṣār ), saying that the second is the result of continuous divine disclosures, repeated flashes of divine magnificence, being overawed by divine unicity and experiencing the wonders of Lordly affairs (Anṣārī, 109; Jāmī, 281; cf. Ibn al-ʿArabī, al-Futūḥāt , 1/270). In this regard, Ibn al-ʿArabī says: ‘Guidance means that man is guided to bewilderment, so that he comes to know that the [Divine] order is [entirely] bewilderment, and bewilderment is non-fixity ( qalaq ) and movement ( ḥaraka ), and movement is life. There is no rest, no death. There is [only] being, without non-being' ( Fuṣūṣ , 188; see idem, al-Futūḥāt , 4/280). Commenting on this expression, Kh w ārazmī says that this perplexity emanates from witnessing the manifold different aspects of divine self-disclosure whose realities are beyond the apprehension of the human intellect ( ʿaql ), imagination ( wahm ), vision ( baṣīra ) or understanding ( fahm ) (p. 729).",
    "Rūzbihān Baqlī invokes the Prophetic tradition, ‘Your praises cannot be enumerated…’ ( lā uḥsiya thanāʾ ʿalayk ) as evidence of the Prophet reaching this state of perplexity ( Sharḥ , 401). In fact, because the mystic cannot apprehend the disclosure of the divine act with the light of his intellect, he falls into perplexity (Rūmī, Mathnawī commentary, 7/33). Mystics believe that witnessing the beauty of the Beloved causes a person to fall into perplexity, bewilderment and awe because they are overwhelmed and lost in contemplation of God’s existence and self-disclosures. Being absorbed in the station of divine union ( maqām al-jamʿ ) is a form of mystical selfishness (Baqlī, Sharḥ , 320, 484; ʿIzz al-Dīn, 410; Sajjādī, 334). In other words, perplexity is a state in which a person is overwhelmed by God’s majesty to the extent that his intellect cannot process his experiences and so he is consumed by awe and wonderment (al-Kalābādhī, 137; al-Kāshānī, ʿAbd al-Razzāq, Sharḥ , 187–188; Iṣṭilāḥāt , 319–320; Baqlī, Sharḥ , 555; al-Ḥallāj, Ṭawāsīn , 47–48; ʿIzz al-Dīn, 410). For Ibn al-ʿArabī, all human attempts to understand the Essence of God can only result in perplexity and incapacity: ‘rational observation leads to ḥayra ; theophanic revelation leads to ḥayra . So there is nothing but being bewildered, no ruling property except ḥayra , nothing but Allāh’ ( al-Futūḥāt , 4/198; see also chapter 50 on the rijāl al-ḥayra , 1/270–272).",
    "The views highlighted above, which are to be found in biographical dictionaries, such as ʿAṭṭār’s Tadhkira and Anṣārī’s Ṭabaqāt , sundry theoretical works on Sufi thought, and poetry (e.g., ʿAṭṭār and Rūmī), were not central to Sufi gnostic practices; nor was ḥayra generally considered a station (sing. maqām , manzil ) or state (sing. hāl ) on the Sufi path. Al-Qushayrī, for instance, notes the concept of ḥayra in his discussions on the ‘Oneness of God’ ( tawḥīd ) and ‘love’ ( maḥabba ) ( Epistle on Sufism , 308, 333), but he does not identify it as a ḥāl or maqām . Ibn al-ʿArabī, however, does sometimes speak of a ‘station of ḥayra ’ in a non-technical sense, identifying it, for example, with the station of fear, when someone is simultaneously fearful of the veil of Absolute Beauty as well as of the lifting of the veil ( al-Futūḥāt , 2/184, 637, 3/490). For him, ultimately ḥayra is not simply a place of being lost but more of finding the meaning of non-existence and realisation of Being. In his ‘contemplation of the light of perplexity as the star of non-existence rises’, he records a divine address: ‘those who stop get lost in perplexity; the heirs become realised in it; the followers work towards it; the servants devote themselves to it; the veracious ones speak from it; it is the place from which the envoys are sent and the place of ascent of the aspirations of the prophets… perplexity is not perplexity – it is only jealousy ( ghayra ) from Me to you’ ( Mashāhid al-asrār , Arabic pp. 95–96, English p. 86). As Chittick remarks in relation to ‘the station of no station’: ‘The gnostic is not bewildered because he is lost, but because he has found’ ( Sufi Path , 380, also pp. 375–81)."
