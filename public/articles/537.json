    "Abdāl , the plural of badal or bidl meaning ‘substitute’ or ‘successor’, which can also mean ‘generous’ ( karīm ) and ‘noble’ ( sharīf ). This name is given to a group of God's servants who, amongst the awliyāʾ (‘friends of God’, saints), have attained a special spiritual station. The term attained particular importance in Sufi literature. The abdāl are deemed to comprise a group of a fixed number of individuals, such that whenever one of them dies, his place is filled by someone from a lower rank of the saints. There are differences of opinion about the reasons for choosing the term abdāl to refer to this group of saints. According to some Shiʿi accounts, it is because they are seen as the heirs or successors of the prophets (al-Qummī, 1/64). But other sources maintain that they are given this name because of the fact that their numbers are fixed, and that as soon as one of them dies, he is ‘replaced’ by another (Āmulī, 276; Ibn al-Athīr, 1/107).",
    "Yet other writers say that this is their title because, when necessary, they can depart from wherever they are, leaving a formal likeness or spiritual image of themselves in their stead (Āmulī, 276; Ibn al-ʿArabī, 2/7). According to Ibn al-ʿArabī (1/160), one of the reasons for using this term to describe these saints is that they are capable of transforming ( tabdīl ) blameworthy human traits and characteristics into praiseworthy ones. This term is generally used by mystics and Sufis and always in connection with the aforementioned accounts. Ibn Khaldūn is of the opinion that the Sufi belief in the quṭb (‘pole’) and the abdāl originates in the Shiʿi concept of the Imam and leader ( naqīb , pl. nuqabāʾ ) (Ibn Khaldūn, 1/631). Among Sufis in the Ottoman empire, the terms abdāl and budalāʾ (sing. badīl ) were used to refer to dervishes, and then with the decline of Sufi orders in these regions, these words were used in Turkish to describe simple-minded and foolish people ( Dānishnāmah , 2/323–324).",
    "AbdāL in Ḥadīth literature",
    "In Shiʿi narratives and prayers this word is sometimes used in reference to the ‘heirs’ ( awṣiyāʾ , sing. waṣī ) of the Prophet, those souls appointed by God as the substitutes or replacements of the prophets (al-Qummī, 1/64). In other sayings, the term abdāl has been used to refer to certain special companions of the Shiʿi Imams (al-Qummī, 1/64). There are also Sunni accounts that attribute certain special qualities to the abdāl . ʿAlī is reported in some of these sources to have said: ‘The abdāl , who number 40, are in al-Shām [Syria], and whenever one of them dies, God replaces him with another. It is by their blessing that God makes the rain fall on the earth, and it is because of them that the Muslims are victorious against their foes, and that God's punishment is removed from the people of al-Shām’ (Ibn ʿAsākir, 1/60; Ibn al-Athīr, 1/107; Ibn Ḥanbal, 112). The Prophet is also reported to have said: ‘Those who are the abdāl in my community ( umma ) are 40 in number; 22 are in Syria and 18 in Iraq. When one dies, God replaces him with another. When God's decree is delivered, they all pass away, and with their departure the Resurrection begins’ (Ibn ʿAsākir, 1/60). According to another saying of the Prophet, there are 30 abdāl in the Prophet's umma , and they are akin to Abraham, ‘Khalīl Allāh’ (‘the intimate friend of God’) (Ibn ʿAsākir, 1/60–61). Yet another narration states that among the people there are 300 whose hearts are like the heart of Adam, 40 whose hearts are like that of Moses, 7 whose hearts are like that of Abraham, 5 whose hearts are like that of Jibrāʾīl (the angel Gabriel), 3 whose hearts are like that of Mīkāʾīl (the angel Michael), and 1 whose heart is like the heart of Isrāfīl (the angel Raphael) (Ibn ʿAsākir, 1/63).",
    "Tāj al-Dīn al-Kh w ārazmī narrates the following saying of the Prophet Muḥammad: ‘There are always 40 people in my community ( umma ) whose nature ( khuluq ) is akin to the nature of Abraham, and they are called the budalāʾ ; 7 who have the nature of Moses, and they are called the awtād (sing. watad , ‘peg’); 3 with the nature of Jesus, who are the khulafāʾ (sing. khalīfa , ‘successor’); and one who has my (i.e. the Prophet's) nature, and he is the quṭb (‘pole’)’ (al-Kh w ārazmī, 33). In the 15th of his collected letters (compiled in a work entitled Baḥr al-maʿānī ), Sayyid Muḥammad Gīsūdarāz narrates a saying, on the basis of which the term abdāl is used to refer to all those awliyāʾ who are ranked in 6 specific levels. Their ranks, numbers and qualifications are as follows: a) one whose heart is like the heart of Isrāfīl; b) 3 whose hearts are like the heart of Mikāʾīl; c) 6 whose hearts are like the heart of Gabriel; d) 7 whose hearts are like the heart of Abraham; e) 40 whose hearts are like the heart of Moses; and f) 300 whose hearts are like the heart of Adam. Whenever one in a higher position dies, another from a lower category replaces him; and if one of the 300 abdāl , whose hearts are like the heart of Adam, passes away, he is replaced by a person from among the general population of the Muslims. It is through these abdāl that God removes all calamities and misfortunes from the Muslim community (see also al-Harawī, 14–15). According to a saying narrated in a Sunni compilation, one attains the station of the abdāl not by performing numerous prayers and fasts, but through possessing a radiant soul, a pure heart and goodwill towards Muslims (Ibn ʿAsākir, 1/61). According to another account, the distinctive traits of the abdāl are that they forgive those who harm them, do good to those who wrong them and share with others all that God bestows upon them.",
    "Abdāl in Sufi literature",
    "One finds considerable differences in Sufi works regarding the attributes and ranks as well as the number of the abdāl . The authors even disagree about the type of saint to which this category refers and where precisely the abdāl figure in the hierarchy of the saints. Within the earliest Sufi works, the abdāl and their attributes are discussed in such books as Abū Ṭālib al-Makkī's Qūt al-qulūb (2/78), Kh w āja ʿAbd Allāh Anṣārī's Ṭabaqāt al-Ṣūfiyya (pp. 415, 513, 611) and al-Hujwīrī's Kashf al-maḥjūb (p. 269). It is in the works of Ibn al-ʿArabī, however, that one finds the most extensive treatment of this subject, and his many commentators elaborate upon his descriptions of the abdāl and their characteristics, their various commentaries containing very little in the way of disagreement. The study of this subject can be dealt with under two headings: a) the attributes and characteristics of the abdāl ; and b) their rank and their numbers.",
    "There is a great difference between what is said in early Sufi literature about the attributes and the characteristics of the abdāl and what Ibn al-ʿArabī and his followers say on this subject. After referring to a saying related on the authority of the ahl al-bayt regarding the importance of patience ( ṣabr ) and contentment ( riḍā ), Abū Ṭālib al-Makkī (2/78) states that contentment with God, compassion towards His creatures, purity of heart and the offering of wise counsels to the Muslims are the characteristics which define the abdāl amongst ‘the sincere’ ( al-ṣiddīqūn ). According to Kh w āja ʿAbd Allāh Anṣārī (pp. 415, 513, 611), miraculous acts of grace ( karāmāt ) are performed only by the abdāl and the ascetics ( zuhhād ), since the performance of such deeds can give rise to pride and self-deception, and only the abdāl are safe from falling into such vices. Another of their attributes is that they avoid killing living creatures. After discussing the ranks of the awliyāʾ , to whom the abdāl belong, al-Hujwīrī (p. 269) mentions the ability of the abdāl to recognise one another, adding that in all matters they act only through mutual consent.",
    "According to Ibn al-ʿArabī (2/7, 9) each of the abdāl is connected to a particular prophet, and he receives the graces of spiritual radiance emanating from the heart of that prophet. It is through them that God protects and preserves the ‘seven spiritual climes’ of the earth ( al-aqālīm al-sabʿa ). The attention of the spiritual dwellers of the seven heavens ( rūḥāniyyāt al-samawāt al-sabʿ ) is focused on them. They are also familiar with the movements and rising and falling of the heavenly bodies within their fixed and predetermined houses. The name of each is a Name of God. Each one of the abdāl is established in a position facing one of the Names of God, and it is by means of a certain Name that they are beheld by God.",
    "Ibn al-ʿArabī also relates what he was told by his companion ʿAbd al-Majīd b. Salama, who was said to have had the grace of being visited by one of the abdāl called Muʿādh b. Ashras: the latter explained that the abdāl attain their station ( maqām ) by adhering to silence ( ṣamt ), wakefulness ( sahar ), enduring hunger ( jūʿ ) and living in seclusion ( ʿuzla ). Ibn al-ʿArabī (2/7) mentions another group of abdāl called the rajabiyyūn , and Shāh Niʿmat Allāh Walī (150–151) refers to Ibn al-ʿArabī's position regarding this group by describing them thus: ‘Each year, from the beginning to the end of the month of Rajab, they are in a state of continuous presence ( ḥuḍūr ) before God. On the first day of Rajab, their state ( ḥāl ) is fashioned by the divine grandeur ( al-ʿaẓama al-ilāhiyya ), as though the entire celestial hierarchy were placed upon their heads; and they remain in such a state until the dawn of the second day. During the second day, a diminution occurs in their state, and as the sun rises on the third day, they become aware of hidden things ( mughayyabāt ) and are granted the honour of perceiving divine manifestations ( tajalliyyāt )’.",
    "ʿAzīz al-Dīn al-Nasafī (p. 318) states, in his description of those awliyāʾ who are fixed in number and are named the abdāl , that these saints have wisdom, they are ‘brought close’ ( muqarrab ) to God, they can also perform karāmāt , they have intense spiritual aspiration ( himma ), they possess great power ( qudra ), and their prayers are granted ( mustajāb ) by God. Such is their spiritual power and their karāmāt that their vision is obscured by neither earth, water, air and fire, nor by deserts and mountains.",
    "Sayyid Ḥaydar Āmulī's description of the abdāl is identical to that given by Ibn al-ʿArabī (pp. 159–160, 164, 264–266). Although Shāh Niʿmat Allāh Walī considers all the awliyāʾ of God as constituting the abdāl , his account of the attributes of the ‘seven abdāl ’ and the rajabiyyūn is taken from parts of Ibn al-ʿArabī's writings dealing with this subject.",
    "There are different opinions among the mystics regarding the number and rank of the abdāl . Ibn al-ʿArabī gives their number as 7, 40 or even 12 (2/5–16). The Shiʿi Saʿd al-Dīn al-Ḥammūʾī maintained that the term walī could only be used for the 12 Imams, of whom the last is the Mahdī, with the term abdāl applying to other eminent mystics and travellers of the spiritual path (al-Nasafī, 320–322). Shāh Niʿmat Allāh Walī (1/149–155) sometimes uses abdāl as a general category comprising all the ranks of the saints, and at other times uses it as a specific group within the category of saints. Leaving aside the general application of the term to all the ranks of the awliyāʾ, in nearly all mystical works the abdāl are said to number either 7 or 40. ʿAlī al-Hujwīrī (p. 269) considers their number to be 40, and places them in the 5th rank of the hierarchy of the awliyāʾ . These ranks are as follows: the quṭb (the ‘pole’) or the ghawth ([one who gives] ‘succour’), consisting of one person only; then come the 3 nuqabāʾ (sing. naqīb , ‘noble’); then the 4 awtād (sing. watad , ‘peg’); then the 7 abrār (sing. barr , ‘pious’); then the 40 abdāl ; and finally, the 300 akhyār (sing. khayr , ‘good’).",
    "ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Jāmī (pp. 20–21) repeats everything said by al-Hujwīrī about the qualities, numbers and ranks of the abdāl . Ibn al-ʿArabī talks about the 7 abdāl and the 40 abdāl , even though, according to him, the 12 nuqabāʾ are also sometimes called the abdāl . He places more emphasis on the 7 abdāl , and he maintains that they are according to the following order, in the footsteps of Abraham, Moses, Aaron, Idrīs, Joseph, Jesus and Adam, their names being respectively ʿAbd al-Ḥayy, ʿAbd al-ʿAlīm, ʿAbd al-Wadūd, ʿAbd al-Qādir, ʿAbd al-Shakūr, ʿAbd al-Samīʿ and ʿAbd al-Baṣīr (Ibn al-ʿArabī, 2/7). Although the abdāl are placed after the quṭb , the aʾimma (sing. imām ), and the awtād , the term may sometimes include all of these. Al-Nasafī (p. 322) regards abdāl as a general term referring to the different ranks of the awliyāʾ , and he thus also uses the term awliyāʾ for the abdāl . He maintains that God's awliyāʾ or abdāl number 356 during each age, and divides them into 6 degrees, the first comprising 300 persons; the second comprising 40; the third, 7; the fourth, 5; the fifth, 3; and finally the sixth and highest, just 1, namely the quṭb . He then explains that when ‘the end of time’ ( ākhir al-zamān ) approaches, nobody will be added to the group of 300 when one of them dies, so that eventually there will be none left in that group. The groups comprising 40, 7, 5 and 3 will then diminish in number until none are left except the quṭb . With the death of the quṭb the world will come to an end (al-Nasafī, 317).",
    "In the introduction to his commentary on Ibn al-ʿArabī's Fuṣūs al-ḥikam , Sayyid Ḥaydar Āmulī offers three divisions regarding the ranks of the awliyāʾ , each including 7 abdāl , but within each division a different rank is ascribed to the abdāl . In the first division the abdāl are placed after the quṭb , and have a more elevated station than the rijāl al-ghayb (‘men [with knowledge] of the unseen’) and the ṣulaḥāʾ (‘the righteous’). In the second division, the abdāl are placed fourth after the quṭb , the ghawth and the afrād (sing. fard , ‘individual, isolated’). In the third division, the abdāl are placed in the fifth position after the quṭb al-aqṭāb (‘the pole of poles’—the rank of the Prophet and the 12 Shiʿi Imams), the quṭb or the ghawth , the aʾimma (‘imams’ in the Sufi rather than specifically Shiʿi sense) and the awtād . In the course of specifying the various ranks of the awliyāʾ , Āmulī makes the point that the Shiʿi Imams are sometimes referred to as the aqṭāb or the abdāl , and it appears that this is inferred from sayings recorded in Shiʿi sources. He also says that what is often meant by the 7 abdāl is the group consisting of the 4 awtād , the 2 aʾimma , and the quṭb (Āmulī, 276). He also takes a new classification from Saʿd al-Dīn al-Ḥammūʾī, on the basis of which the abdāl are 7 in number, occupying the fifth of 7 ranks after the quṭb , ‘the ghawth and the two imams’ (occupying one rank), the awtād and ashbāḥ (sing. shabaḥ , ‘apparition’), with the total number of awliyāʾ in all these levels being limited to 360 (Āmulī, 277).",
    "Shāh Niʿmat Allāh Walī (1/149–155), however, gives a different classification of the awliyāʾ , in which the term abdāl is sometimes used in its general meaning and sometimes in its particular sense. According to his first classification, the 7 abdāl are placed second after the 12 aqṭāb ; and the 40 and the 300 abdāl are respectively in the 4th and 6th position. In his second classification, the groups of 3, 5, 7, 40 and 300 abdāl are placed after the quṭb al-aqṭāb . Finally, his third classification is almost identical to the second, the sole difference being that the position of one of the awliyāʾ is between the quṭb al-aqṭāb and the 3 abdāl .",
    "It would appear that the diverse classifications of the awliyāʾ in later works, such as those by Āmulī and Shāh Niʿmat Allāh Walī, as well as the differences that exist between the positions and the ranks of the abdāl , are not unrelated to the ambiguity and diversity found in Ibn al-ʿArabī's treatment of the subject in his Futūḥāt . After referring to the 7 abdāl , Ibn al-ʿArabī mentions the rajabiyyūn or the 40 abdāl , while also referring to the sayings of certain eminent figures on the 12 abdāl . Ibn al-ʿArabī then discusses the particularities of the 300 awliyāʾ , and again mentions the subject of the different levels of ‘the men of the world of breaths’ ( rijāl ʿālam al-anfās ), without clarifying the connections between them and the rijāl previously mentioned by him (Ibn al-ʿArabī, 2/3–16 et passim)."
