    "Al-Būshanjī was one of the great authorities of his time on both doctrinal exposition and spiritual practice ( muʿāmalāt ). At the same time, the fact that he was devout, ascetic and an adept in the way of futuwwa who felt himself duty-bound to help anyone in need (al-Sulamī, 481; Anṣārī, 421; Jāmī, ed. ʿĀbidī, 230) is borne out by a number of anecdotes related about him (al-Ghazālī, 2/179; al-Qushayrī, 249; ʿAṭṭār, 2/76; Ibn al-Mulaqqin, 254–255; Ibn al-Jawzī, 204).",
    "On his return to Būshanj from Iraq, al-Būshanjī was accused of being zindīq (ʿAṭṭār, 2/75). As Anṣārī (p. 421) puts it, ‘There may have been some flaws in his doctrinal tenets, or error in his manner of expression.’ This may explain why he moved to Nīsābūr and devoted himself to a life of worship, avoiding contact with people, until his death (Ibn ʿAsākir, 11/840; al-Subkī, 3/344; Ibn al-Mulaqqin, 252). He is said to have kept away from both the Friday prayers and other communal prayers, and to have replied, when reproached on this account: ‘If blessings lie in congregation ( jamāʿa ), well-being ( salāma ) lies in isolation ( ʿuzla )’ (Ibn al-Jawzī, 289; Ibn ʿAsākir, 11/843). Al-Būshanjī died in Nīsābūr. The funeral rites were conducted by his student Abū al-Ḥasan al-ʿAlawī (Ibn ʿAsākir, 11/841; Ibn al-Mulaqqin, 252), and he was buried next to the graves of Ḥamdūn al-Qaṣṣār al-Nīsābūrī (d. 271/884, founder of the Malāmatiyya Sufi order), Abū ʿAlī al-Thaqafī (d. 328/940) (one of the latter’s followers) and ʿAbd Allāh b. Munāzil (4th/10th Sufi and muḥaddith of the Shāfiʿī school) (al-Ḥākim al-Nīsābūrī, 145; Ibn ʿAsākir, 11/840, 841).",
    "Although al-Būshanjī is not credited with the authorship of any writings, several sayings of his concerning futuwwa , altruism ( muruwwa ) and Sufism are recorded in biographical sources. His best-known dictum is probably: ‘Sufism is a name without a reality. Formerly it was a reality without a name’ (al-Sulamī, 482 Hujwīrī, 59)."
