    "Abū Ṣāliḥ Ḥamdūn b. Aḥmad b. ʿUmāra (or ʿImāra) b. Ziyād b. Rustam al-Qaṣṣār al-Naysābūrī (d. 271/884–5) was a Ṣūfī master of Nīshāpūr and a leader of the Malāmatiyya (lit., school of blame), whose proponents thought that all outward appearence of religiosity was ostentation and that real piety should remain hidden. The Malāmatiyya spread throughout Khurāsān under his influence (al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , 123–9). Ḥamdūn was a disciple of Salm (or Sālim) b. al-Ḥasan al-Bārūsī, whom he recognised as his master (ustādh) (al-Sulamī, Mustakhraj , § 1, 339). Little is known about al-Bārūsī, save that he was critical of Muḥammad b. Karrām (d. 255/869), founder of the Karrāmiyya ascetic movement, and his disciples (al-Sulamī, Taʾrīkh al-ṣūfiyya , cited in al-Samʿānī, 1:255–6; Knysh, Islamic mysticism , 95). Amongst Ḥamdūn al-Qaṣṣār’s teachers, the biographical sources mention also Abū Turāb al-Nakhshabī (d. 245/859–60)—whom Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Sulamī (d. 412/1021), the famous exegete, hagiographer, and theorist from Nīshāpūr, cites as one of the last surviving masters of the first generation of Ṣūfī authorities (al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , 146–51)—and ʿAlī al-Naṣrābādhī, an otherwise unknown figure. Some sources also make him out to be a disciple of Abū Ḥafṣ al-Ḥaddād (d. between 264/877–8 and 270/883–4; al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt al-ṣūfiyya ), another leader of the Malāmatī movement in Nīshāpūr. Amongst these sources is Ḥākim al-Naysābūrī (d. 405/1014), the great traditionist and historian of Nīshāpūr, who attributes the education of Ḥamdūn al-Qaṣṣār solely to Abū Ḥafṣ (Karīmī, 46). Al-Sulamī inverts this relationship of authority, stating instead that Abū Ḥafṣ bestowed the title of ustādh (professor, master) on Ḥamdūn al-Qaṣṣār (al-Sulamī, Mustakhraj , § 2).",
    "1. Scholar, transmitter of ḥadīth s, jurist, and master of the Malāmatiyya",
    "Ḥamdūn was a learned scholar, transmitter of ḥadīth s, and jurist of the school of al-Thawrī (d. 161/778). Little is known about his life. Ḥamdūn died in Nīshāpūr and was buried in the cemetery of al-Ḥīra. He is said to have had a son, Abū Ḥāmid, a respected traditionist (ḥāfiẓ) known by the surname al-Aʿmashī (al-Dhahabī, Siyar , 14: 553–5) due to his careful collection and transmission of the ḥadīth s of the traditionist and Qurʾān reader Abū Muḥammad al-Aʿmash (d. 148/765). No known written works are attributable to him, which is not surprising, as the early Malāmatiyya refused to compose texts (al-Sulamī, Risāla , 119; Deladrière, 99–100). He did, nevertheless, copy and transmit ḥadīth s (al-Sulamī, Mustakhraj , § 1, 339); al-Samʿānī mentions the names of some of his masters and disciples in this domain (al-Samʿānī, 4:508).",
    "All the sources consider him the master of the Malāmatiyya and the one responsible for the spread of this spiritual path from Nīshāpūr. That is why, according to al-Sulamī, his path was seen as distinct from the Baghdadis’ path. He represents, however, only one part of a broader spiritual current that included various attitudes and tendencies (Sviri, Ḥakīm Tirmid̲ī, 596–606). Al-Hujwirī calls Qaṣṣārīs those disciples who followed his path (al-Hujwirī, 183–4). Abū Muḥammad ʿAbdallāh b. Muḥammad b. Munāzil al-Muṭarriz (d. 331/942–3) was his most loyal disciple and perpetuated his master’s teachings (al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , 366–9; al-Sulamī, Mustakhraj , § 2, 339; Sviri, Early mystical schools, 462–8), but Ḥamdūn influenced other illustrious masters, such as Maḥfūẓ b. Maḥmūd (d. 303/915–6 or 304/916–7) from Nīshāpūr (al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , 273–4) and Abū ʿAlī al-Thaqafī (d. 328/940), who, according to the Central Asian religious scholar, Ṣūfī manualist, and hagiographer al-Qushayrī (d. 465/1072), may have introduced Baghdadi Ṣūfism to Nīshāpūr (al-Qushayrī, 164). His teachings were recorded principally by al-Sulamī, who dedicated a short work to him titled Mustakhraj min ḥikāyāt Ḥamdūn al-Qaṣṣār (“Compendium of sayings attributed to Ḥamdūn al-Qaṣṣār”), in which he collected fifty-eight of his dicta; the remainder of his teachings were scattered throughout the Ṣūfī literary corpus.",
    "Several sources consider him to have been one of the abdāl (lit., substitutes; Karīmī, 49; al-Samʿānī, 4:508; al-Dhahabī, Siyar , 13:51), the saintly elite. But for al-Ḥākim al-Naysāburī, the first to have used this designation, the term could also apply more generally to pious men. Al-Sulamī, our earliest authority on the Malāmatiyya, concludes his epistle dedicated to this group with the opinion of Abū l-Ḥasan al-Ḥuṣrī (d. 371/982) (al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , 489–93), his contemporary and master of the Baghdadi Ṣūfīs at the time, who declared that, if another messenger of God were to appear after the prophet Muḥammad, he would come from the ranks of the Malāmatiyya (al-Sulamī, Risāla , § 45, 119; al-Kharkūshī, 25). This comment should be understood in the context of the rivalry between the local spiritual schools of the third/ninth century, notably those of Baghdad and Nīshāpūr, which occasionally competed with one another, and as an homage by the Baghdadi Ṣūfī masters to the eminent spiritual movements in Khurāsān in general and Nīshāpūr in particular. Nonetheless, this praise must have been cited by the authorities of Nīshāpūr, to show that Baghdadi masters recognised the authority and even the superiority of their spiritual path. Later sources indicate that Ḥamdūn is one such figure worthy of becoming this hypothetical prophet (Jāmī, 60).",
    "2. Ḥamdūn’s path",
    "The path of Ḥamdūn is characterised by three fundamental prohibitions: preaching and public instruction; wearing of particular garb; and abandoning one’s craft or trade in order to dedicate oneself to a spiritual life (al-Sulamī, Mustakhraj , § 16, 17, 11, 35; Ṭabaqāt , § 2, 6, 14, 25). This last can be traced back to the ban on any ostensible sign of spirituality, which arose as a reaction to the practices of the Karrāmīs, who preached precisely the opposite. On the inner level, Ḥamdūn emphasised the permanent and general deficiency or imperfection of acts of adoration, encouraging his disciples to maintain a state of constant humility. He was receptive to religious science (ʿilm) and encouraged his disciples to visit all scholars, even exotericists (al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , § 17, 127; al-Sulamī, Mustakhraj , § 24, 25, 43; al-Iṣfahānī, 10:231–2). He was reported by some to be scrupulous, especially in matters of inheritance (al-Qushayrī, 115; Jāmī, 61). He followed ascetic practices that were common during his lifetime and frequently referred to his pious predecessors (salaf) (al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , § 3, 19; al-Sulamī, Mustakhraj , § 14). Al-Ḥākim, in his Taʾrīkh Naysābūr (“History of Nīshāpūr”), describes him only as an ascetic (Karīmī, 46). Ḥamdūn defined his path, which would become that of the Malāmatiyya, as requiring his followers to “renounce self-embellishment for the sake of others through one’s spiritual state and likewise to refrain from seeking their approval with sundry acts or attitudes (akhlāq) and to do so without letting oneself be swayed by the slightest criticism in one’s duty to God” ( Mustakhraj , § 32). This statement would subsequently be summarised in the expression, “Demolish external appearances in order to cultivate one’s inner being, while remaining completely obedient to the Law” (al-Dhahabī, Siyar , 13:50), an agenda that perhaps led to forms of social marginalisation or to conformity in external appearances. It is difficult to know if the traits so characteristic of Ḥamdūn al-Qaṣṣār’s spirituality were intended to oppose those of the Karrāmīs (and eventually those of other spiritual groups in Nīshāpūr) or to distinguish themselves from the Baghdadi Ṣūfīs.",
