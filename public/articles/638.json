    "al-Daylamī, Abū al-Ḥasan (d. ca. 392/1001–1002), ʿAlī b. Muḥammad, was a well-known Sufi author who lived in Shīrāz during the 4th/10th century. Little is known about his life. It is only by indirect evidence that we can affirm that he was related to the Daylamī families who, in the first half of the 4th/10th century during the reign of the Būyids, migrated from northern Iran southward and settled particularly in the region of Fārs. It is probable, therefore, that he was born in the first half of the 4th/10th century (Rūzbihān Baqlī, Abhar , Persian introd., 4–5, ibid., French introd., 15–16; al-Daylamī, A Treatise , introd., 12–14).",
    "His teacher in ʿirfān (gnosis) was Shaykh Abū ʿAbd Allāh b. al-Khafīf al-Shīrāzī (d. 371/982), known as al-Shaykh al-Kabīr (the great master), who was himself the son of one of the Daylamī chieftains of ʿAmr b. al-Layth al-Ṣaffār (r. 265/879–289/902, q.v.), on which basis he is considered a Daylamī of Fārs. During his youth, from about 352/963 onwards, Abū al-Ḥasan al-Daylamī practised spiritual wayfaring ( sulūk ) under the guidance of Ibn al-Khafīf. Al-Daylamī compiled accounts of the life and words of his master in a book named Sīrat al-Shaykh al-Kabīr Abū ʿAbd Allāh b. al-Khafīf al-Shīrāzī (al-Daylamī, Sīrat 9; al-Daylamī, A Treatise , introd., 22; Böwering, ‘Deylamī’, 338). These accounts indicate that al-Daylamī interacted and associated with most of the disciples and companions of Ibn al-Khafīf (e.g. see al-Daylamī, Sīrat , 25, 32–33, 37–38, 198–199, 204–205; trans. by Junayd al-Shīrāzī, 47–49, 50–52, 102–105).",
    "According to an account quoted from him in Shadd al-izār , it appears that he also met Abū Naṣr al-Sarrāj al-Ṭūsī (d. 378/988) and Abū ʿAbd Allāh Ḥusayn b. Aḥmad al-Bayṭār (d. 363/974) (trans. by Junayd al-Shīrāzī, 47; Böwering, ‘Deylamī’, 338). Certain things in this book, according to al-Daylamī, were transmitted from and on behalf of Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī (d. 414/1023), which demonstrates that al-Daylamī knew and associated with him as well (trans. by Junayd al-Shīrāzī, 53–54, 104). This fact has led some scholars to suggest that the philosophical ideas expounded in al-Daylamī’s ʿAṭf al-alif were borrowed from Abū Ḥayyān or conceived under his influence. According to textual evidence, al-Daylamī seems to have visited Mecca, Baghdad, and Antioch, and most likely some other cities, but he eventually returned to Shīrāz, where he remained for many years. There is no extant information about the place where he died, his tomb, his disciples or his family (al-Daylamī, Le traité , introd., 4–5, 8, ibid., A Treatise , introd., 20–21, 63–64; al-Qushayrī, 231–132; Massignon, 229–230; Böwering, ‘Deylamī’, 339).",
    "Al-Daylamī’s fame rests on his treatment of the subject of divine love ( al-ʿishq al-ilāhī ) in a scholarly manner in his important work ʿAṭf al-alif al-maʾlūf ʿalā al-lām al-maʿṭūf , his presentation of the ideas of al-Ḥallāj in the same work, and his account of the life and words of Abū ʿAbd Allāh Ibn al-Khafīf.",
    "Works",
    "1. ʿAṭf al-alif al-maʾlūf ʿalā al-lām al-maʿṭūf (The attachment of the alif of union to the lām of inclination): This book is written in Arabic, and researchers consider it the first and oldest Persian Sufi text on the theme of divine love. In it al-Daylamī produced a selection of opinions from philosophers, physicians, theologians, scholars, men of letters, Sufis, Bedouin Arabs and astrologers, and gave his own views alongside (al-Daylamī, Le traité , introd. 2; Walzer, 407, 413; Abrahamov, 36).",
    "As for the book’s title, it is almost certainly a play on a saying of the Prophet that begins: ‘The believer befriends and is befriended’ ( al-muʾmin ilf al-maʾlūf  ): if the hamza and vowels are not present in writing, ilf and alif are homographs. Al-Daylamī probably borrowed it from a work by al-Ḥallāj named Alif al-maʾlūf , alternatively, this title may be based on some verses of al-Ḥallāj that al-Daylamī quotes in his Sīrat . In these verses, which discuss the letters in the name ‘Allāh’ and how the lām is united to the ‘compassionately inclined’ alif ( al-alif al-maʿṭūf ), al-Ḥallāj says: ‘My heart is captivated by four letters…the alif that bestows the intimacy that is innate to created beings, the [first] lām that prevails over censure ( malāma )…then the [second] lām that overflows with meanings, and then the hāʾ that bewilders and afflicts me’ (al-Daylamī, Sīrat , 236, idem, A Treatise , introd., 56–57; Ibn al-Nadīm, 358; Massignon, 229).",
    "This view is confirmed by the fact that al-Daylamī was the first person after al-Ḥallāj’s execution to narrate the words and ideas of al-Ḥallāj, especially on the theme of divine love, and give an account of his life in his books, ʿAṭf and Sīrat . There is no doubt that through his teacher, Ibn al-Khafīf, he became acquainted with the character and ideas of al-Ḥallāj. In transmitting these topics, he benefited from both the personal reminiscences of Ibn al-Khafīf and the writings of al-Ḥallāj that Ibn al-Khafīf probably passed on to him (al-Daylamī, Sīrat , 54, 72, 93–94 et passim; Massignon, 229–230).",
    "While compiling his ʿAṭf , al-Daylamī drew on various sources, one of the most important of those being the oral discourses of his master, Ibn al-Khafīf. Furthermore, Ibn al-Khafīf himself wrote at least two short treatises on the subject of love, to which al-Daylamī had recourse while writing his own book (al-Daylamī, ʿAṭf , 244–245, ibid., A Treatise , introd., 22–23). He also drew on the works and sayings of Sufis like ʿAmr b. ʿUthmān al-Makkī (d. 291/903 or 297/909), Abū al-Qāsim al-Junayd (d. 298/910), Abū Saʿīd Aḥmad b. Muḥammad b. Ziyād al-Aʿrābī (d. 341/952, known as Ibn al-Aʿrābī), Abū Sulaymān al-Dārānī (d. 215/830, q.v.), Sahl al-Tustarī (d. 283/896), as well as on the works of al-Ṭabarī and al-Masʿūdī. With regard to the philosophical ideas and the sayings of philosophers found in this work, most scholars consider them to be an outcome of al-Daylamī’s acquaintance with Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī, who was trained in philosophy. However others, through comparing the quoted statements with Greek texts, have concluded that it is more likely that al-Daylamī had access to an Arabic translation of a collection of sayings from the Greek philosophers, which he used in composing his own book (al-Daylamī, A Treatise , introd., 63–64; Massignon, 230; Walzer, 407 ff.).",
    "As stated in the preface of the manuscript of the ʿAṭf , the book was first transmitted by Abū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī b. Bakrān al-Faḍl al-Shīrāzī (an important Sufi in Fārs and follower of al-Daylamī), who transmitted it to Abū Shujāʿ Muḥammad b. Saʿdān al-Maqārīḍī (d. 509/1115) (al-Daylamī, ʿAṭf , 3, ibid., A Treatise , introd., 65–66).",
    "The ʿAṭf contains 24 chapters, of varying lengths. Al-Daylamī first expounds on whether the word passionate love or eros ( ʿishq ) can be applied to love for God and from God, after which he comments on such topics as: beauty ( ḥusn ), the beautiful ( ḥasan ), and the admirer of beauty ( mustaḥsin ); love ( maḥabba ), its derivation and meanings;  ʿishq ; the different views on the essence of love; the description and nature of passionate love or eros; those who praise love and lovers ( muḥibb ) and the virtues of the beloved ( maḥbūb ); those who disparage love; the effects and signs of love; God’s love for the human, and the human’s love for God; the characteristics of God’s lovers; love for all beings; the perfection of maḥabba ; and those who die of love or kill themselves for love or die in love. In most of these chapters, following a short introduction of the subject matter, he quotes various statements on the topic. In some of the chapters, he presents the views of literati, philosophers, theologians and Sufis in greater detail. In some, after narrating all the points of view, he adds his own thoughts on the subject (al-Daylamī, ʿAṭf , 35 ff.).",
    "As stated, the main subject of this book is divine love, its essence and quiddity, its attributes and effects. After devoting the first four chapters to beauty ( ḥusn ), love ( ḥubb ), and the various derivations and meanings of love, al-Daylamī turns his attention in chapter five to the principle of love ( maḥabba ) and passionate love ( ʿishq ) and the origin of these two. After narrating the opinions of philosophers such as Empedocles (q.v.) and Heraclitus of Ephesus, he presents his own doctrine on it, which according to his own testimony, is based on the teachings of Ḥusayn b. Manṣūr al-Ḥallāj. He says that al-Ḥallāj’s doctrine is closely aligned with the teachings of these ancient philosophers ( ʿAṭf , 51). What is examined in this part of the book is a specific type of ontology based on love: God, from among the attributes of perfection which He possesses, revealed Himself through passionate love ( ʿishq ), and this attribute, like the other attributes of perfection, has a form in His essence and is ultimately identical to His essence. As he puts it, quoting al-Ḥallāj at length, ‘Then [God] contemplated, through the perfect totality of His attributes, the attribute of  ʿishq in Himself, which is a form in His essence that is His essence….Then He contemplated the quality of  ʿishq through all qualities, and He discussed with Himself about it in all details. Then He spoke to it with all speech; then He greeted it with the totality of greeting... Were all the people of the earth to write with all the trees on earth and all the water of the sea, they could not record all that He spoke and confided to it. All this was from His essence, and to His essence’ ( ʿAṭf , 53–54, A Treatise , 41). During the stages of God’s attending to love, other attributes gradually became distinguished, through which the manifold forms of existents and multiple worlds were created. At the same time, He manifested a form that was His own form and His own essence, ‘a person ( shakhṣ ) who was Himself… and when God had gazed on him and possessed him, He revealed Himself within him and from him’ (al-Daylamī, ʿAṭf , 52–55, A Treatise , 40–43).",
    "In al-Daylamī’s worldview, the three hypostases of lover, love, and beloved are one thing. He holds that unity ( aḥadiyya ) is fundamentally closer to and more manifest in three than in two, ‘since two is an equal sharing, whereas three is a singling out ( ifrād )’ ( ʿAṭf , 76, A Treatise , 62). Al-Daylamī asserts that ‘some have maintained that love divided into two: lover and beloved, love not being distinct from them. This is an error… For this reason the Christians are closer to the true profession of divine unity ( tawḥīd ) in their doctrine of the Trinity than are the Zoroastrians in their dualism… for they assert otherness, opposition and division’ ( ʿAṭf , 76–77, A Treatise , 62).",
    "In the same chapter al-Daylamī also summarises some of his most important teachings following a meditation on the meaning of letters and numbers. ‘The alif is an indication of the divine Unity ( tawḥīd ). It is a breath-letter (a long vowel) that cannot be grasped (or: takes neither vowels nor diacritical points) and that has no sensible form. Rather, it is perceived in the first instance by the imagination. If you wish to bring forth the alif from the realm of the imaginable to that of the intelligible, you must give it a graphic likeness’ In writing, the alif stands alone and is not joined to anything, although all other letters are joined to it. Although single, it is composed of three things, the placing of the pen on the paper to make a point, the prolongation of the point into a line, and the lifting of the pen. Hence it is a pointer to ‘the essential Oneness of Reality ( aḥadiyyat al-ḥaqq ) because it reflects His isolation, His self-subsistence, and the subsistence of all things in Him. Then if you wish to bring the alif from the realm of the intelligible into that of the knowable ( maʿrūf ), in order to have knowledge of the intellect’s conception of this single intelligible and self-subsistent form, you join together ( allafta ) three letters ( alif , lām , fā ), which being thus joined ( taʾlīf  ) guide you to knowledge of the essence of this one thing’ ( ʿAṭf , 76–77, A Treatise , 61). He considers reflecting on the spelling of the verbal root alif , lām , fā , a way to understand the three-fold unity of lover, beloved, and love. Therefore, the act of allafa (uniting, joining together) is the same as the act of God, which is love, between the other two, namely, the lover and the beloved ( ʿAṭf , 77, A Treatise , 62).",
    "Continuing this theme in the context of number, al-Daylamī states that ‘if the number reaches 1,000 ( alf  ), a repetition [of the number one] is involved’. Given that the letter alif is one, not only as the first letter of the alphabet and its form as a vertical line, but also in terms of its numerical value (according to the abjad system, q.v.), the movement of one toward 1,000, that is to say, its progression from the beginning to the end of numerical terms, is actually the return of the one to its principle, since the end, 1,000 ( alf  ), is identical to the beginning, one ( alif ), in terms of their written form in Arabic: ‘You can reduce the end to the beginning, and the beginning to the end. It (the one) is the first and the last, the manifest and the concealed. It is the beginning of everything and the end of everything’ (al-Daylamī, ʿAṭf , 77–78, A Treatise , 63).",
    "Al-Daylamī aims to explain how the universe came into existence, in accordance with his ontological theory of love. But this is only part of a broader explanation of how man traverses the arc of ascent through the mediation of love until he attains the station of unity. According to al-Daylamī, on this journey man passes through ten different stations and stages, the first of which is familiarity or closeness ( ulfa ). After this follow the stages of intimacy or delight ( uns ), fondness or endearment ( wudd , mawadda ), real love ( maḥabba ), bosom friendship ( khulla ), ardent love or fascination ( shaʿaf  ), infatuation or heart-smiting love ( shaghaf ), abandon or reckless love ( istihtār ), delirium or rapture ( walah ), and bewilderment or loss of endurance ( hayamān ). Finally, these ten categories are synthesised in the eleventh and final stage, the station of ʿishq , in which love overflows all bounds and the lover has no consciousness of anything except the beloved. This state is also known as divine intoxication ( sakra ) and overpowering ( ghalaba ). From an existential point of view, God transfers the servant’s attributes to the sphere of His own attributes, and encompasses his relationship in His own relationship, in such a way that the two become one and no distinction remains between the lover and the beloved. As long as the servant remains in this state of annihilation ( fanāʾ ), there will never be any separation between the two ( ʿAṭf , 44–50, A Treatise , 31–36).",
    "In other chapters, al-Daylamī investigates the lover’s attributes and how they are transformed, which he does in a most unusual manner, both in terms of the way in which the topic is discussed and in terms of the number of statements in each context which he managed to collect.",
    "In another respect, al-Daylamī may be regarded as a bridge between Sahl al-Tustarī and the Sufis of Fārs, particular Rūzbihān al-Baqlī. He preserved a large part of this tradition in the ʿAṭf in the form of the sayings of Sahl al-Tustarī. One of the most important themes propounded by Sahl is that of divine light as the unifying reality of mystical love between the Prophet and God, as well as the idea of the Muḥammadan light. As related in the ʿAṭf , Sahl al-Tustarī believed that God has three seeds ( dharr ): Muḥammad, Adam, and Adam’s posterity. When God desired to create Muḥammad, He first produced from His light another light [i.e., the Muḥammadan light] which He spread through all existence, and when it came before (God’s) majesty, it prostrated itself, and from its prostration a column of dense light like a glass vessel was created. In this column of light Muḥammad worshipped God for a thousand thousand years. Then God created Adam from the light of Muḥammad, and from Adam’s light the chosen ones, and from their light their followers and aspirants (al-Daylamī, ʿAṭf , 68, A Treatise , 54). After quoting these words of Sahl al-Tustarī, al-Daylamī adds that for the same reason the love of every lover issues from the source or mine ( maʿdin ) of the heart of Muḥammad, which is the source of the essence of the profession of divine unity, the bed of the spiritual knowledge of the gnostics, and the spring of mystic wine that intoxicates the hearts of the lovers ( ʿAṭf , 69, A Treatise , 55; Böwering, The Mystical , 28, 34, 153 ff.). In his Sharḥ-i shaṭḥiyyāt , Rūzbihān Baqlī quotes some statements from al-Ḥallāj on the topic of the Muḥammadan light that closely resemble the statements presented in the ʿAṭf . This may be evidence that Sahl al-Tustarī and al-Ḥallāj share a common legacy in this regard (Rūzbihān Baqlī, Sharḥ , 459, 517).",
    "The tradition transmitted by al-Daylamī had a lasting influence on the Sufis of Fārs, Rūzbihān al-Baqlī in particular. There is strong evidence for this in the works of Rūzbihān based on his familiarity with al-Daylamī’s ʿAṭf and his borrowing from it. For example, as a number of researchers have demonstrated, the influence of the teachings of the ʿAṭf can be seen in the second, third, fifth and sixth chapters of Rūzbihān’s ʿAbhar al-ʿāshiqīn , in some of which are found exact quotations from the ʿAṭf (al-Daylamī, Le traité , introd., 12 ff., ibid., A Treatise , introd., 67–68; Takeshita, 115–121, 125–127). In another respect, while Rūzbihān investigates the principle of passionate love ( ʿishq ) in his Mashrab al-arwāḥ , in addition to quoting al-Daylamī on this topic and mentioning him by name, he transmits numerous sayings and definitions from individuals like Heraclitus of Ephesus, Abū Ḥafṣ al-Ḥaddād al-Nīsābūrī (d. ca. 270/879), Abū al-Qāsim al-Junayd and Ibn al-Khafīf, a number of which appear to have been borrowed directly from al-Daylamī’s ʿAṭf (al-Daylamī, ʿAṭf , 29, 39, 49, 51–52, 71; Rūzbihān Baqlī, Mashrab , 134–135; ).",
    "2. Sīrat al-shaykh al-kabīr Abū ʿAbd Allāh b. al-Khafīf al-Shīrāzī . In this work, which was written in Arabic, al-Daylamī gives an account of the life of his master, Abū ʿAbd Allāh b. al-Khafīf, including both his words and his deeds until the time of his death. In some chapters he commemorates the Sufi masters with whom Ibn al-Khafīf associated. With the same purpose, with complete courage, and despite the unfavourable environment of his time, in chapter six, which deals with the masters whom Ibn al-Khafīf had met in Iraq, he recounts seven stories of the life of al-Ḥallāj, including an account of Ibn al-Khafīf’s meeting with al-Ḥallāj in prison (al-Daylamī, Sīrat , 93–103).",
    "The Arabic original of this book has apparently been lost, but a Persian translation of it by Rukn al-Dīn Yaḥyā b. Junayd Shīrāzī is extant. It was edited by Annemarie Schimmel and published in Ankara.",
    "3. Mashyakha . This is another work by al-Daylamī in which he apparently gives accounts of the lives and sayings of the Sufi masters and gnostics of Fārs, but there is no extant copy. Subsequently the book was used by Abū Shujāʿ Muḥammad b. Saʿdān al-Maqārīḍī, the author of Mashyakhat al-Maqārīḍī , Ṣāʾin al-Dīn Ḥusayn b. Muḥammad b. Salmān (d. 664/1265), the author of Tārīkh-i mashāyikh-i Fārs , Muʿīn al-Dīn Aḥmad Zarkūb Shīrāzī (d. 789/1387), the author of Shīrāz-nāmah , and Junayd Shīrāzī ( d. 791/1388), the author of Shadd al-izār fī ḥaṭṭ al-awzār ʿan zuwwār al-mazār (al-Daylamī, A Treatise , 22; Junayd al-Shīrāzī, 4; Zarkūb Shīrāzī, introd., 21; Böwering, ‘Deylamī’, 339).",
    "Apart from these works, al-Daylamī refers to another work of his in the ʿAṭf named Asrār al-maʿārif (The secrets of gnosis), which is now lost. Helmut Ritter also attributed to him a treatise entitled al-ʿAqīda al-ṣaḥīḥa without providing his source (see Ibn al-Dabbāgh, introd., 5; al-Daylamī, A Treatise , introd., 22 n. 38; )."
