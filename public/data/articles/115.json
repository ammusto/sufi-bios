    "BESṬĀMĪ (Basṭāmī), ABŪ MOḤAMMAD BĀYAZĪD b. ʿEnāyat-Allāh, a 10th/16th-century faqīh and Sufi of Khorasan. Born in Besṭām, he spent most of his life in Mašhad, a fact alluded to in the title of one of his works, Toḥfat al-marżīya le’l-hażra al-rażawīya . The subject of this book is taslīm (submission), and it is therefore sometimes known as Resāla-ye taslīm . He also wrote books on the question of predetermination and on the timing of the five canonical prayers."
