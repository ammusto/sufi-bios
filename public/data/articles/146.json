    "( a. ), verbal noun meaning “seizure”, “grasping”, “contraction”, “abstention”, etc., and used in the special vocabulary of various disciplines. i.—In fiḳh the word signifies taking possession of, handing over. In Mālikī law ḥiyāza is more frequently used. Tasallum is also employed to mean the act of handing over. Taking possession is accomplished by the material transfer of the thing when movable goods are involved; by occupation when it is a question of real estate, but also symbolically by the handing over of the keys or title deeds of the property. Ḳabḍ only has a subsidiary role to play in the sale, since fiḳh , from the very beginning and in all its versions, recognized that the ownership of the thing which has been sold, when a definite object is involved, is transferred immediately by the agreement of the parties, before any formal transfer. The part played by the ḳabḍ in the matter of gifts ( hiba ), loan ( ḳarḍ ), commodate ( ʿariyya ) and security ( rahn ), is a subject of dispute amongst the legal schools. The Mālikīs excepted, most authors teach that the agreement of the parties on which these contracts are founded does not carry with it any legal obligation on the part of the one who gave the undertaking, nor any absolute right on the part of the beneficiary. The former cannot be forced to hand over the thing he has promised, nor can the latter demand its transfer, ḳabḍ . These contracts are “efficacious”, therefore, only on the basis of the ḳabḍ , freely agreed. The formula of the classical authors, according to which ḳabḍ is useful for the completion ( tamām , luzūm ) of these contracts, is \n ¶ not sufficiently significant. Properly speaking, these contracts only become juridically valid through the operation of the ḳabḍ . Only the Mālikī school holds that immediately after the agreement of the parties relative to a gift, loan, commodate or security the beneficiary may constrain the man who made the contract to hand over the object (Dardīr, al-S̲h̲arḥ al-ṣag̲h̲īr , ii, 344 for the gift; ii, 226-9 for the commodate; ii, 121 for the security).",
    "However the ḳabḍ becomes a condition of the validity of the agreement itself ( s̲h̲arṭ al-ṣiḥḥa ) as regards two contracts which become invalid if the material transfer does not take place at the time of the agreement: these are the salam , or forward sale (the price to be paid at the time of the contract) and the ṣarf , contract of exchange (exchanged currencies must be transferred there and then).",
    "Ḳabḍ amāna and ḳabḍ ḍamān . In regard to contracts which involve the temporary transfer of something from one contracting party to the other, in particular hiring, commodate, safe custody and mandate, there arises the question as to whether this taking possession is a ḳabḍ amāna , in which case the trustee is only held responsible if he has been at fault or in transgression ( taʿaddī ) of the rules of the contract or of the customary dealings in such matters, or if it is a case of a ḳabḍ ḍamān , which holds the trustee responsible for any loss arising in respect of the object, even through chance or circumstances over which he has no control. The Ḥanafīs are of the opinion that in all these contracts, without exception, ḳabḍ amāna is the only possibility. The S̲h̲āfiʿīs and the Ḥanbalīs make a distinction according to whether the contract is concluded in the interests of the trustee (commodate, hiring), in which case the ḳabḍ is ḍamān , or whether the contract is profitable chiefly to the owner of the thing (safe custody, mandate), and in this case it is ḳabḍ amāna . As for the Mālikīs, they adopt another criterion. According to whether the thing held in trust in accordance with one of the contracts outlined above can be concealed easily ( mā yug̲h̲ābu ʿalayhi ) or with difficulty, in the first case they enforce the consequences of ḳabḍ ḍamān , and in the second those of ḳabḍ amāna .",
    "ii.—In Ṣūfism, a technical term used to denote a spiritual state of “contraction” as opposed to “expansion”, basṭ [ q.v. ].",
    "According to al-Ḳus̲h̲ayrī [ q.v. ]: “just as ḳabḍ is above the degree of k̲h̲awf (fear) and basṭ above that of rad̲j̲āʾ (hope), so hayba (reverential awe) is above ḳabḍ , and uns (intimate ease) is above basṭ ”. The explanation of this hierarchy is clearly that ḳabḍ and basṭ denote the pure objectivity of the ʿārif (gnostic) untinged with any individual subjective reaction such as fear and hope, while on the other hand hayba and uns denote a greater degree of unveiling on the part of the Divinity. The end of the path is when Divine Subjectivity obliterates the objective experience of ḳabḍ and basṭ in a transcendent synthesis of the two. The terms themselves, as used by the Ṣūfīs, spring \n ¶ from the Divine Names [see \n al-asmāʾ al-ḥusnā\n ) al-Ḳābiḍ (He who causes contraction) which is an ism d̲j̲alālī (Name of Majesty) and al-Bāsiṭ (He who causes expansion), which is an ism d̲j̲amālī (Name of Beauty); and the Ṣūfīs frequently use d̲j̲alāl and d̲j̲amāl as synonyms of ḳabḍ and basṭ when referring to the divinely subjective experiences of the ʿārif (gnostic). Aḥmad al-ʿAlawī [see ibn ʿalīwa ] quotes his S̲h̲ayk̲h̲ as saying, in moments of ḳabḍ: \n “My Majesty is One with My Beauty”; and he comments: “Since the gnostic is with Him who contracts, not with the contraction itself, and with Him who expands, not with the expansion itself, he is active rather than passive and has thus become as if nothing had happened to him . . . Let your attribute be kamāl (perfection) which is beatitude in both d̲j̲alāl and d̲j̲amāl” .",
    "iii.—In prosody ḳabḍ means “contraction”. To the exposition in the article ʿarūḍ , 671-2 and in G. Weil, Grundriss \n und \n System \n der altar abischen \n Metern , Wiesbaden 1958, 27, 30, the following may be added (on some of the rules governing the ḳabḍ there is no agreement and a complete survey cannot be given):",
    "The ḳabḍ is a suppression of the fifth quiescent letter in the feet faʿūlun and mafāʾīlun which occur in the metres ṭawīl [ q.v. ], hazad̲j̲ , muḍāriʿ [ q.v. ], and mutaḳārib [ q.v. ], so that these feet are reduced to faʿūlu and mafāʾilun respectively. A foot suffering This alteration is called maḳbūḍ (This last term occurs already in a discussion of poetry in the\n Sīra of Ibn Isḥāḳ [ q.v. ], but its meaning is uncertain, see R. Blachère, Deuxième \n contribution , in Arabica , vi (1959), 133, 141).",
    "The shortening of mafāʾīlun to mafāʾīlun is obligatory in the last foot of the first hemistich ( ʿarūḍ ) of all varieties of the ṭawīl , so that this foot can never appear in its “primitive” form, except in case the first hemistich rhymes with the second ( taṣrīʿ , see ḳāfiya ). The same is true of the last foot of the second hemistich ( ḍarb ) of the second variety (which would imply that the ḳabḍ belongs not only to the ziḥāfāt , but also to the ʿilal , see Muḥammad b. ʿAlī al-Ṣabbān, al-Kāfiya al-s̲h̲āfiya fī ʿilmay al-ʿarūḍ wa’l-ḳāfiya , Cairo 1321, 10). The ḳabḍ is also recommended (according to some it is obligatory) in the penultimate foot of the third variety of the ṭawīl . In this variety the last foot of the second hemistich is reduced to faʿūlun , and the penultimate foot, which is also faʿūlun , should become faʿūlu . This rule also applies to the first hemistich in case of taṣrīʿ . On the other hand the ḳabḍ may not occur in the metre mutaḳārib when the penultimate foot of either hemistich has been reduced to a single closed syllable ( fal or faʿ , but cf. Darstellung , 283), and in all cases where the foot mafāʾīlun has already been reduced to mafāʾīlu ( kaff ). Finally it should be noted that in the metre muḍāriʿ the foot mafāʾīlun appears never in its primitive form, but is always changed into mafāʾilun or mafāʾīlu (cf., however, Ṣabbān, al-Kāfiya , 32, l. 7-8)."
