    ", technical term of mysticism, meaning “retirement, seclusion, retreat” (from k̲h̲alā \n “to be alone”), and, more specifically, “isolation in a solitary place or cell” ( zāwiya , [ bayt al- ] k̲h̲alwa ), involving spiritual exercises. “Seclusion” or “solitude” in general (syns. ʿuzla , waḥda , infirād , inḳiṭāʿ ) is one of the fundamental principles of asceticism ( zuhd ); and the predilection of early Muslim ascetics for the solitary way of life is a prominent topic of Ṣūfī hagiographie literature. The example of Christian asceticism is likely to have exercised a certain influence in the formation of this ideal, though orthodox Muslim authorities, e.g. Sufyān al-T̲h̲awrī (d. 161/778), are also quoted as favouring a life in separation from society (Abū Nuʿaym al-Iṣbahānī, Ḥilyat al-awliyāʾ , Beirut 1387/1967, vi, 376, ll. 20-2). The Ṣūfī D̲h̲u ’l-Nūn al-Miṣrī (d. 245/860) learnt from a Syrian hermit about the “sweetness of seclusion, invocation ( d̲h̲ikr ) and of secret conversation with God in private ( al-k̲h̲alwa bi-munād̲j̲ātihi )” ( Ḥilyat al-awliyāʾ , ix, 356, ll. 14-15). The same Ṣūfī is frequently quoted as “knowing of no better incitement to bring about spiritual sincerity ( ik̲h̲lāṣ ) than k̲h̲alwa ”; and another celebrated Ṣūfī, Abū Bakr al-S̲h̲iblī (d. 334/945), is \n ¶ said to have given this advice, “Cleave to solitude, abolish your name from the (memory of the) people, and face the wall (of prayer) until you die!” (al-Ḳus̲h̲ayrī, Risāla , Cairo 1379/1959, 55 f.; Abū Ḥafṣ al-Suhrawardī, ʿAwārif al-maʿārif , Beirut 1966, 210; cf. Rūmī, Mat̲h̲nawī , i, vv. 643-9). However, the statements of classical early Ṣūfīs quoted by Ḳus̲h̲ayrī ( Risāla , 54-6) and G̲h̲azālī ( Iḥyāʾ ʿulūm al-dīn , Cairo 1352/1933, ii, 197-216) reflect a wide spectrum of opinions as to the relative virtues of “solitude” and “community” ( ṣuḥba , muk̲h̲ālaṭa ). Spiritual isolation from the world was considered higher than material seclusion; and it is clear that periodic retreats rather than permanent seclusion were pracised in reality. The Sunna certainly does not favour the solitary way of life, and community life was, in fact, increasingly becoming a characteristic feature of Ṣūfīsm itself. Thus, Abu ’l-Ḥusayn al-Nūrī (d. 295/907-8) is said to have strongly commended “community” as a means to practise “altruism” ( īt̲h̲ār ) (ʿAṭṭār, Tad̲h̲kirat al-awliyāʾ , ed. Nicholson, London-Leiden 1907, ii, 46, and Abū Yaʿḳūb al-Sūsī of Baṣra ( ca . 300/900) is quoted with this statement: “Only the strong ones are able to support solitude, whereas community life ( al-id̲j̲timāʿ ) is more beneficial for people like us, so that each individual’s behaviour is controlled by each other” (Abū Naṣr al-Sarrād̲j̲, Kitāb al-lumaʿ , ed. Nicholson, London-Leiden 1914, 207, 11. 19-21; Ḳus̲h̲ayrī, Risāla , 56, 11. 1-3).",
    "In post-classical Ṣūfīsm, the situation is essentially the same. According to Abū Ḥafṣ al-Suhrawardī ([ q.v. ], d. 632/1234), it is community life which distinguishes the Ṣūfīs from the ascetics, but Suhrawardī explains this difference by claiming that the Ṣūfīs prefer community because, due to their spiritual “health”, they are free from the temptations from which the ascetics tried to escape by choosing the solitary way of life ( ʿAwārif , 108). Still, the Ṣūfīs’ spiritual sustenance is “solitude” ( ibid ., 221), and even in the “common room” ( bayt al-d̲j̲amāʿa ) of the Ṣūfī ribāṭ [ q.v. ], they are supposed to sit on their prayer carpets as if these were their individual retreat ( ibid ., 108). Besides, the Ṣūfī establishment often has individual cells; and the practice of periodic retreats, which plays an important role in Ṣūfī education ( tarbiya ), is developed into a real institution. Suhrawardī devotes three chapters of the ʿAwārif to its description ( op . cit ., 207-27). Special emphasis is also placed on it by the Kubrawiyya, the S̲h̲ād̲h̲iliyya, the Ḳādiriyya and, of course, the K̲h̲alwatiyya. This k̲h̲alwa involves the “Major Holy War” (cf. Rūmī, Mat̲h̲nawī , v, vv. 3785-6), i.e. ascetic discipline, notably vigils, gradually increased fasting, and concentration of the mind, mainly by means of d̲h̲ikr [ q.v. ]. On entering k̲h̲alwa , one should free oneself from wordly possessions and be in a state of ritual purity. Being in the cell should evoke the idea of being in the grave (‘Ammār al-Bidlīsī, ca . 600/1200, in Kubrā, Fawāʾiḥ al-d̲j̲amāl , ed. F. Meier, Wiesbaden 1957, text 60, introd. 32); the cell itself should be a dark room prohibiting the entering of daylight. Its purpose is the “closing up of the external senses” and the “opening of the internal senses” (Kubrā, in M. Molé, Traités mineurs de Naǧm al-Din Kubrā , in Annales Islamologiques , iv (1963), 25; cf. Fawāʾiḥ al-d̲j̲amāl , text 18), i.e. readiness for mystical experiences. However, warnings against attaching too much value to such experiences ( waḳāʾiʿ al-k̲h̲alwa ) are voiced frequently; the guidance of a spiritual director is, therefore, considered vital. According to Suhrawardī, visionary experiences and extrasensory perceptions in general may serve a certain purpose \n ¶ on the mystic way, but the ultimate goal of k̲h̲alwa is rather the experience of the “d̲h̲ikr of the divine Essence” through consubstantiation ( tad̲j̲awhur ) of its light in the heart ( ʿAwārif , 216, 219).",
    "This institutionalised seclusion is normally limited to periods of forty days, which is why it is also called al-arbaʿīniyya , or čilla (from Persian čihil ); it should not be interrupted except for ritual community prayers, and it should be repeated once every year ( ʿAwārif , 221). It is conceived as an imitatio prophetae , the prophet Muhammad’s custom to retreat in a cave in Mt. Ḥirāʾ before he received the Ḳurʾānic revelation being taken as a traditional basis. However, the number forty is linked to the example of other prophets as well, especially Mūsā (cf. Ḳurʾān VII, 138/142). It also symbolises the “forty stages” of the universe, which is the scene of the mystic “journey” ( ʿAwārif , 207 f.; ʿAṭṭār, Muṣībat-nāma , cf. H. Ritter, Das Meer der Seele , Leiden 1955, 18 ff.).",
    "At the same time, the k̲h̲alwa extends ideally over the whole life of the Ṣūfī ( ʿAwārif , 221, 226). The practice of retreat is only a means to an end, and the goal of Ṣūfī education is k̲h̲alwa \n “in spirit” ( k̲h̲alwat al-maʿnā ), i.e. being spiritually with God in spite of material presence in the world (Kubrā, Fawāʾiḥ , al-d̲j̲amāl , 60). The same idea is expressed in the Naḳs̲h̲bandī formula of k̲h̲alwat dar and̲j̲uman (solitude in society). Similarly, Ibn ʿArabī is not speaking of the common practice of retreat when he considers k̲h̲alwa as the highest maḳām ; he takes it to mean the absolute “emptiness” ( k̲h̲alāʾ ) of the Perfect Man, i.e. the state of being “filled” with the Absolute ( al-Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya , Cairo 1270, ii, 166 ff.)."
