    ", a composite word of Persian origin meaning a building usually reserved for Muslim mystics belonging to a dervish order. The terms ribāṭ , tekke and zāwiya [ q.vv .] refer to establishments with similar aims. After an early period of evolution which is still imperfectly known, these all became widespread throughout the Islamic world down to modern times. The usual translation of “monastery” does not, however, convey the complexity of the institution.",
    "Etymology. From the outset, k̲h̲ānḳāh appears in two forms, sometimes in the same author: (1) the Persian form k̲h̲ānagāh , often lightened to k̲h̲ānagah , with the nisba of k̲h̲ānagāhī ( Ḥudūd al-ʿālam , 107; Frye, The histories of \n Nishapur , ii, 8a, 22b, 41b, iii, 19a; al-Samʿānī, Ansāb , v, 29; Yāḳūt, s.v. Marw ) ; and (2) the Arabised form k̲h̲ānḳāh and its variant k̲h̲āniḳa \n . The nisba of k̲h̲ānḳāʾī seems to be used only by the geographer Muḳaddasī ( Aḥsan al-taḳāsīm , 44), whilst the normal term is k̲h̲ānḳāhī ( ibid ., 323; Frye, i, 41a, 46b; al-Samʿānī, v, 29; Yāḳūt, s.v. K̲h̲āniḳa ). These uncertainties are also felt in the plural. K̲h̲awāniḳ , or sometimes k̲h̲awānik (al-Maḳrīzī, K̲h̲iṭaṭ , ii, 414) is mainly used by Arabic authors, but there is also found the Arabo-Persian form k̲h̲ānagāhāt (read as k̲h̲ānkāhāt in Arabic) and the Persian plural k̲h̲ānagāhā , especially in Persian texts. In regard to meaning, the two component elements are easily identifiable: -gāh , Persian locative suffix becoming usually -ḳāh in Arabic; and k̲h̲ān/k̲h̲āneh with the same ambivalence as bayt \n “house”, “room” ( Burhān-i qāṭiʿ , s.v.). On the other hand, the general sense is quite obscure. In mediaeval times, other etymologies were put forward, starting from k̲h̲ w ān \n “table” or from the root of the verb k̲h̲ w āndan \n “to recite”. These etymologies have the advantage of providing the word with a satisfactory sense in regard to its evolution in the context of mysticism (place of the table, of recitation), but they can only be accepted in defiance of the most elementary rules of Persian orthography and Arabo-Persian phonetics: the vocable k̲h̲ w ā never loses its w in Persian orthography, and if it passes into Arabic, becomes k̲h̲awā or k̲h̲iwā , cf. Pers. k̲h̲ w ān cited above, which becomes Arabic k̲h̲īwān .",
    "History. The word k̲h̲ānḳāh seems to appear first of all in authors of the 4th/10th century, who describe it as an institution of their own time and localise these establishments above all in K̲h̲urāsān and Transoxania. The anonymous author of the Ḥudūd al-ʿālam , writing in Gūzgān in 372/982, gives on this topic highly valuable, though unfortunately so far unconfirmed in other sources, information: “In Samarqand stands the monastery of the Manichaeans ( k̲h̲ānagāh-i Mānaviyān ) who are called nighūshāk (“auditores”)” ( Ḥudūd al-ʿālam , 107, tr. Minorsky, 113). If one bears in mind the valuable information from the same period given by Ibn al-Nadīm in the Fihrist about the transfer of the centre of Manichaeism from Babylonia to Sog̲h̲dia, the presence of these Manichaeans at Samarḳand is not surprising. In regard to this establishment’s functions, the use of the word “auditores” seems to show that it was a centre of worship as well as of teaching and evangelism, according to the traditional \n ¶ and well-tried Manichaean system of militant evangelism (Puech, Manichéisme , 86 ff.).",
    "A second, highly-important piece of evidence on the early k̲h̲ānḳāhs is provided by another contemporary, al-Muḳaddasī. According to him (179, 182, 238, 323, 365, 377), the k̲h̲ānḳāhs belonged exclusively to the theological and ascetic sect of the Karrāmiyya. The Karrāmī groups flourishing above all in K̲h̲urāsān, Transoxania, D̲j̲urd̲j̲ān and Ṭabaristān, and those of the west in Jerusalem and around the tomb of Ibn Karrām there (d. 255/869), all had their k̲h̲ānḳāhs . The nisba of k̲h̲ānḳāʾī used by al-Muḳaddasī seems to be reserved for the Karramīs alone. Mystics (the later users of k̲h̲ānḳāhs ) are generally called by him (44, 118, 188, 415, 430) Ṣūfīs, distinguished by him into specific groups and linked only with masd̲j̲ids or ribāṭs of the countryside. If one takes this information into account, it must be admitted that the early history of the k̲h̲ānḳāh cannot be properly elucidated until the early evolution of the Karrāmiyya and their eventual connections with the Manichaeans are examined [see \n karrāmiyya\n ].",
    "However, from the end of the 4th/10th century there seems to be an evolution of the k̲h̲ānḳāhs (appearance of directors of them in Nīs̲h̲āpūr, Frye, i, 36b, 41a, 46b, 55b; al-Samʿānī, nisba of k̲h̲ānḳāhī ; al-Subkī, Ṭabaḳāt , iii, 131, 344, iv, 127) into establishments connected with certain groups which become almost totally identified with them and largely disguise their origins. These groups are those of the Ṣūfīs, often allied to S̲h̲āfiʿism and As̲h̲ʿarism; the emergence together of these and their links in eastern Persia have been too little studied (but see H. Halm, Die Ausbreitung \n der schafiitischen \n Rechtsschule , Wiesbaden 1974, and for the Ṣūfī-S̲h̲afiʿī links, Les étapes \n mystiques du shaykh \n Abū Saʿīd , tr. M. Achena, Paris 1974, 36).",
    "The first half of the 5th/11th century is one of founding and organisation. The Ṣūfī Abū Saʿīd [see \n abū saʿīd b. abi ’l-k̲h̲ayr\n ] (d. 440/1048) drew up a code of ten rules for the people in the k̲h̲ānḳāh (Achena, op . laud ., 324, already noted by Nicholson, Studies \n in Islamic mysticism , 46). He was considered by the next generation as the first to have regulated the communal life in the k̲h̲ānḳāhs \n “according to rules still in use today” (Frye, ii, 74a). Such an enterprise inevitably led to the fabrication of references to it in the past. This is doubtless the reasoning behind the legend of the first k̲h̲ānḳāh , allegedly built at Ramla at the opening of the 2nd/8th century (al-Anṣārī, Ṭabaḳāt al-Ṣūfīyya , 9; in fact, according to al-Muḳaddasī, 164 ff., the district of Ramla was sprinkled with coastal ribāṭs ). Moreover, the terminology was still indefinite ; madrasa could mean a centre for Ṣūfīs (R. Bulliet, The patricians of Nishapur , Cambridge, Mass. 1972, 253-4), and duwayra often alternates with k̲h̲ānḳāh to denote the same establishment ( duwayra/k̲h̲ānḳāh of al-Sulamī, in Frye, ii, 82a, iii, 6a, 18a, 27a, 42a, 73a). Finally, from this period onwards, certain k̲h̲anḳāhs are also burial places, a fact which enabled them to benefit from the largesse of pious pilgrims (Frye, ii, 47a).",
    "The second half of the century is marked by the alliance, in effect, of the people of the k̲h̲ānḳāhs with the Sald̲j̲ūḳ ruling power. The ideological linkage of Ṣūfīsm with S̲h̲āfiʿism-As̲h̲ʿarism in K̲h̲urāsān now enjoyed an unprecedented expansion, not only on a local scale, but also outside the region (naturally, Ḥanafism was also able to adapt itself and integrate itself within this movement). Sald̲j̲ūḳ expansionism, far from being territorial and political only, was often linked with an ideological expansionism, based in \n ¶ the first instance on the spirited policies of official patrons. Niẓām al-Mulk and his K̲h̲urāsānian imitators were not the only ones to found madrasas and k̲h̲ānḳāhs (examples of such patronage at Nīs̲h̲āpūr in Frye, ii, 78b, iii, 192). The Sald̲j̲ūḳs of the west and their slave commanders, masters of Syria in the third quarter of the 5th/11th century, speedily imitated them at Aleppo and Damascus (lists of Syrian\n k̲h̲ānḳāhs in al-Nuʿaymī, Dāris , ii, 139-91, for Damascus; this list repeated with another for Aleppo and other towns by Elisséeff, Nūr ad-dīn , iii, 765-71). In Damascus, however, there seem to be two k̲h̲ānḳāhs dating from the pre-Sald̲j̲ūk period; but in reality, these early foundations seem to have had little connection with the later developments in their function and probably only received the name of k̲h̲ānḳāh from the Sald̲j̲ūḳ period onwards ( Dāris , ii, 146, 151, nos. 164, 166; Elisséeff, op . laud ., iii, 768, n. r). From that time onwards, ribāṭ and k̲h̲ānḳāh seem to become synonymous; at the end of the 6th/12th century, Ibn D̲j̲ubayr wrote concerning Ayyūbid Syria, “As for the ribāṭs , called here k̲h̲ānḳāhs , there are many of them; they are meant for Ṣūfīs, and are splendid palaces, since Ṣūfīs are real Kings in this country” ( Riḥla , 256). In ʿIrāḳ, the word ribāṭ predominated (J. Chabbi, Fonction \n du \n ribāṭ à Baġdād , in REI , xlii/1 (1974); Achena, op . cit ., 351).",
    "In Egypt, the foundation of k̲h̲ānḳāhs , following the Sald̲j̲ūḳ tradition, began logically under the Ayyūbids after the fall of the Fāṭimids in the later 6th/12th century. It continued under the Mamlūks, but with some slowing-down after the second half of the 8th/14th century. The k̲h̲ānḳāhs were then gradually transformed into official institutions, hence controlled and not always linked to the Ṣūfī orders, which accordingly tended to move into institutions enjoying more autonomy.",
    "Often they became part of complexes containing several institutions, e.g. masd̲j̲id-madrasa- mausoleum. Nevertheless, terminology remained still imprecise, and mediaeval historians could not always agree on the name for such and such institution (see for all this period, art. al-ḳāhira , list of monuments shown on map, and section on Mamlūk\n k̲h̲ānḳāhs ; al-Maḳrīzī, K̲h̲iṭaṭ . ii, 414-27). From the Ottoman period onwards (10th/16th century), k̲h̲ānḳāhs were still founded, but they appeared more and more in the form of the Turkish institution of the tekke (Pers. takya , Ar. takiyya ). A good number of these various institutions have survived to the present days (see al-ḳāhira , section on the Ottoman period, Madrasas , tekkes ). There is, however, a general conclusion to be drawn here: that whilst the k̲h̲ānḳāhs did not pass beyond Egypt, constituting the last wave of the original Sald̲j̲ūḳ expansion, the Turkish tekkes were carried along by the Ottoman conquests and reached the Mag̲h̲rib.",
    "During this time, in the east the K̲h̲urāsānian k̲h̲ānḳāhs swiftly spread beyond the Sald̲j̲ūḳ domains and reached the eastern Iranian fringes and Afg̲h̲ānistān, sc. the territories of the G̲h̲aznawids and then the G̲h̲ūrids (middle of the 6th/12th century). The severe local upheavals involving these powers seem to have affected them little, but the opposite became true with the Mongol invasions of the early 7th/13th century. The last G̲h̲ūrids, soon replaced by their slave commanders, founders of the Dihlī sultanate, fled to India. There followed a migration, which included the Ṣūfīs, comparable to that accompanying the westwards advance of the Sald̲j̲ūḳs. This does not of course imply that all the Persian k̲h̲ānḳāhs disappeared during the Mongol period, nor that new \n ¶ institutions were not built ( Cambridge \n history of \n Iran , v, 372, 511).",
    "But from the course of the 7th/13th century onwards, two new dervish orders, the Čis̲h̲tiyya and Suhrawardiyya, founded by refugees and soon based upon a widespread network of k̲h̲ānḳāhs , appeared in the new sultanate (Kh. A. Nizami, Some \n aspects of \n Khānqah \n life in medieval India , in St . Isl . viii (1957), 52-69; see also čis̲h̲tiyya and dihlī ). In the 8th/14th century, the reforms imposed on the Ṣūfī movement by Sultan Muḥammad Tug̲h̲luḳ; took the form of a resumption of k̲h̲ānḳāhs but also of the extension of their network in the Indian territories [see \n d̲j̲alāl al-dīn al-buk̲h̲ārī\n ]. This type of institution, brought from Persia in the 7th/13th century, prospered more there than almost anywhere else right down to modern times and constitutes one of the characteristic manifestations of Indian Islam [see \n hind, v (a) ].",
    "Constitution and functions. It is impossible to give here more than a few bibliographical references, since such a study would be intertwined with the immense and complex question of the links between Ṣūfīsm and its various forms and the contemporary society and ruling institutions. The most exhaustive work is J. S. Trimingham’s\n The Sufi \n orders in Islam , Oxford 1971 ; for the way of life in K̲h̲urāsānian k̲h̲ānḳāhs , Achena, op . laud ., 79, 81, 97, 165, 180, 356, etc.; for Egyptian ones, al-Maḳrīzī, K̲h̲iṭaṭ , is a rich source; for Indian ones, Nizami, op . laud .",
    "Architecture. Since they were institutions meant both for leading the communal life (rooms for prayer, corporate sessions) and also for sheltering individual mystics, often in significant numbers, all k̲h̲ānḳāhs contained both types of accommodation (and frequently too various annexes and dependent buildings permitting self-sufficiency). However, there was a great gulf between the sumptuous buildings founded under official patronage (Syria, Egypt) and the first Indian k̲h̲ānḳāhs . But neither of these gave rise to a special type of architecture distinct, for instance, from that of the madrasas (Elisséeff, Nūr ad-dīn , iii, 265, 266). Moreover, at the end of the Circassian period in Egypt (9th/15th century), the k̲h̲ānḳāhs were integrated within great funerary complexes; they ceased to have individual living-rooms within them, and became non-residential centres for Ṣūfī activities [see \n al-ḳāhira\n , section on the Mamlūk period, K̲h̲ānḳāhs ]."
