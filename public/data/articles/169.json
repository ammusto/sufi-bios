    "( a. ), literally “chain”, a term used in the terminology of Ṣūfism and the Ṣūfī orders ( ṭuruḳ ) for a continuous chain of spiritual descent, a kind of mystical isnād [ q.v. ]. This connected the head of an order, the s̲h̲ayk̲h̲ or pīr , with a person regarded as the order’s founder and back to the Prophet. These \n ¶ persons might stem from early Islam, such as the Yemeni contemporary of the Prophet, Uways al-Ḳaranī (actually, not initiated directiy but after the Prophet’s death, in a dream), and the Patriarchal Caliphs, especially Abū Bakr, ʿUmar and ʿAlī. That such claims to descent were fictitious, given the obviously intensely practical and unmystical bent of the first caliphs, was early recognised by some authorities, such as Ibn K̲h̲aldūn [ q.v. ] (who suspected here S̲h̲īʿī influence; see his Muḳaddima , iii, 73-4, tr. Rosenthal, iii, 93-4). Somewhat more plausible were silsila s traced back to early undoubted Ṣūfīs like Abū Yazīd al-Bisṭāmī (d. 261/875 or 264/878 [see \n abū yazīd\n ]) and Abu ’l-Ḳāsim al-D̲j̲unayd (d. 298/910-11 [ q.v. ])."
