    "( a. ), a maṣdar formation from form V of the root d̲j̲-l-w , which means “to appear, to come to light, to be clear or brilliant”. Rabāḥ b. ʿAmr al-Ḳaysī (d. ca . 180/796) of Irāḳ seems to have been the first to use this term to designate the manifestation of God to a person at the time of the Judgement and then in Paradise (L. Massignon, Essai sur les origins du lexique technique de la mystique musulmane , Paris 1922, 217).",
    "Sahl al-Tustarī (d. 283/896) introduced it into Ṣūfism, giving it a meaning which is reproduced in the manuals of the 10th and 11th centuries (G. Böwering, The mystical vision of existence in classical Islam , 172-5 and index s.v. taǧallī ; al-Kalābād̲h̲ī, al-Taʿarruf li-mad̲h̲hab ahl al-taṣawwuf , Damascus 1986, 121-2; al-Ḳus̲h̲ayrī, Risāla , Damascus 1988, 74; al-Sarrād̲j̲, al-Lumaʿ fi ’l-taṣawwuf , ed. Nicholson, Leiden 1914, 362, etc.). The tad̲j̲allī consists of mukās̲h̲afa , an “unveiling”, which allows divine light to “irradiate” the heart of the meditator; it therefore releases human nature from its darkness in the same way that the sun chases away gloom (cf. Ḳurʾān, XCII, 2).",
    "The influence of al-Tustarī is also equally noticeable in the Sālimiyya, a spiritual movement which grew from him, as in his disciple al-Ḥallād̲j̲ (L. Massignon, Passion , 2 Paris 1975, i, 432, 568, 621, iii, 181-2; but note that Massignon has a tendency to “Christianise” the word tad̲j̲allī by translating it as “transfiguration”, and in fact Christian Arabs use this same term to denote the Transfiguration of Christ).",
    "Later mystics retain the meaning of “unveiling” in the term (cf. Ibn al-ʿArabī, Iṣṭilāḥ al-ṣūfiyya , in Rasāʾil , Ḥaydarābād 1948, 9, and this is often taken up again by other authors) while also exploring its range of meaning for initiation. Tad̲j̲allī reveals divine knowledge which is in the heart of man, thus opening to him the pathway to gnosis. Such theophany is so powerful (according to Ḳurʾān, VII, 143, it reduced Mount Sinai to dust before the eyes of Moses) that it made the human ego volatile. Mystics then experiment by attempting to annihilate the “Sinai of the soul”, according to the formula of Kubrawī Ṣūfīs (cf. the introduction of H. Landolt to N. Isfararayini, Révélateur des mystères , Lagrasse 1986, 106; and see also M. de Miras, La méthode spirituelle d’un maître du Soufisme iranien , Nur Ali-Shah , Paris 1973, 295, 322). Therefore a person can only tolerate theophanies of divine attributes, names and acts, and these paradoxically form “so many protective veils between the divine essential being and the creature”.",
    "The term tad̲j̲allī also has a metaphysical and a cosmogonic meaning; as the correlative of the first, it \n ¶ appears in Ṣūfism, especially from Ibn al-ʿArabī onwards. The Arab philosophers were already using tad̲j̲allī in such a perspective. For Ibn Sīnā, souls and the tangible world flow by “irradiation” from the actuating intellect, which itself comes from God, the supreme light (L. Gardet, La pensée religieuse d’Avicenne , Paris 1951, 52, 166). In the work of the falāsifa , as in that of the later mystics, the notion of tad̲j̲allī shows affinities with that of fayḍ , the theory of “emanation”, borrowed from Plotinus.",
    "Ibn al-ʿArabī, who distinguishes the two terms, made the first one of them the foundation for his metaphysical doctrine. Ibn Ḵh̲aldūn puts tad̲j̲allī elsewhere as a characteristic tenet of the major representatives of “the school of theophany” ( ahl or aṣḥāb al-tad̲j̲allī ) which in his opinion represents the major current of thought in “modern” Ṣūfism ( S̲h̲ifāʾ al-sāʾil li-tahd̲h̲īb al-masāʾil , Tunis 1991, 212; Muḳaddima , tr. V. Monteil, Discours sur l’Histoire universelle , Beirut 1968, 1017-22; however, the poet Ibn al-Fāriḍ, who is also included in this changing hierarchy, favours the term fayḍ ). According to Ibn al-ʿArabī, multiplicity extends gradually outwards from unity, through a long unbroken line of theophanies, which assume countless different forms; the world continues to exist thanks to “perpetual creation” ( k̲h̲alḳ d̲j̲adīd ). By the “irradiation” of the Divine Essence on them, creatures pass from nothingness to existence, or from virtual existence to effective existence. Everything or every being is therefore a “theophanic locus” ( maẓhar , mad̲j̲lā ), a receptacle ( ḳābil ) which receives this “irradiation” according to its pre-dispositions ( istiʿdād ). Consequently, man sees only his own image in the divine mirror.",
    "Elsewhere, most of the masters deny that God is revealed to objects in His Essence ( tad̲j̲allī d̲h̲ātī ; cf., e.g. Ibn al-ʿArabī, al-Futūḥāt al-makkiyya , Cairo 1329, ii, 606). For Tād̲j̲ al-Dīn al-Subkī ( Ṭabaḳāt al-s̲h̲āfiʿyya al-kubrā , Cairo 1964, ii, 312), an author as early as al-Ḳus̲h̲ayrī had this perception of tad̲j̲allī , but he was afraid to divulge its esoteric implications in his Risāla ( loc . cit .).",
    "Ibn al-ʿArabī develops the metaphysics of tad̲j̲allī in many passages of his works (in particular the Fuṣūṣ al-ḥikam and the K. al-Tad̲j̲alliyāt ; for this last work, use the edition of O. Yahia in al-Mas̲h̲riḳ [1966-7]). This doctrine has clearly diffused mainly into the school of Ibn al-ʿArabī (Ḳās̲h̲ānī, Ḏj̲īlī, Ḳayṣarī, etc.) but also into more orthodoxly Sunnī Ṣūfism (cf. for example K. al-Tad̲j̲alliyāt of the S̲h̲ād̲h̲ilī Ibn Zag̲h̲dān, ms. Berlin We II, 1505), Imāmite gnosis (cf. La philosophie \n shiʿite , texts by H. Amoli, ed. H. Corbin and O. Yahia, Paris-Tehran 1969), and also to Ismāʿīlī gnosis (ʿAzīz-i Nasafī, Le livre de l’homme parfait , ed. M. Molé, Paris-Tehran 1962; H. Corbin, Trilogie ismaélienne , Paris-Tehran 1961); the Ismāʿīlīs already professed the doctrine of the cycles of occulation ( satr ) and of manifestation ( tad̲j̲allī )."
