    "( a. ), a term in the terminology of Ṣūfī mysticism meaning “ecstasy, rapture”. Al-Tahānawī states that wad̲j̲d \n “refers to a divine influx of inspiration which strikes the inner being of the Ṣūfī, generating either sadness or joy in him. It may also change his condition in some way, making him absent from his personal qualities by means of a vision of God” ( Kas̲h̲s̲h̲āf iṣṭilāḥāt al-funūn , Bibl. Indica, Calcutta 1862, 1454).",
    "The term derives from the root w-d̲j̲-d , with a range of meanings including “to find, obtain, experience, be moved by passion”. Hence we have such masdars as the wad̲j̲d under consideration and wid̲j̲dān \n “feeling, sentiment, ecstasy”. See further on this range of meanings, F. Jabre, Essai \n sur le lexique de \n Ghazālī , Beirut 1970, 270.",
    "In the period of classical Ṣūfism, the development of wad̲j̲d as a technical term was bound up with scholastic discussions on moral theory which flourished in the Ṣūfī school of Bag̲h̲dād. Ibn ʿAṭāʾ’s (d. 309/921) celebrated dispute with al-D̲j̲unayd (d. 298/910 [ q.v. ]) on whether wad̲j̲d is characterised by the presence of joy or grief in the mystic is perhaps the most famous in this regard. Whereas al-D̲j̲unayd declared that ecstasy means “dissociation, severance ( inḳiṭāʿ ) from one’s personal qualities while one’s essence is graced with joy”, Ibn ʿAṭāʾ agreed only partially with this definition, replacing the word “joy” by “grief” (al-Tahānawī, loc . cit.; L. Massignon, The Passion of al-Ḥallāj , mystic and martyr of Islam , tr. H. Mason, Princeton 1982, i, 92). Another member of this school, al-K̲h̲arrāz (d. 277/890 or 286/899 [ q.v. ]), said in his K. al-Ṣifāt , in which he analysed the experience of proximity to God ( ḳurb ), describing the various stations traversed by the mystic to attain that degree, that wad̲j̲d is the first station experienced by those who have proximity to God. Al-K̲h̲arrāz’s understanding of wad̲j̲d has been described by P. Nwyia as not so much “ecstasy” as “instasy”, a communion with oneself in order to find ( wad̲j̲ada ) the word of God within and so be delighted ( Exégèse \n coranique et langage mystique , Beirut 1970, 254, 259).",
    "Many of the same ontological connotations of wad̲j̲d figure in the enigmatic meditations on annihilation of al-D̲j̲unayd, who explains that wad̲j̲d and wud̲j̲ūd belong to the final degree of the three stages of annihilation of the selfhood in the divine ( fanāʾ [see \n baḳāʾ wa-fanāʾ\n ]). The concept of existing as a kind of annihilation of self was also often emphasised in later mediaeval Ṣūfism, and figures in the expositions of the spiritual stations [see \n Ḥāl\n ] of the mystical ascent to perfect love by most of the Ṣūfī authors, often with great intricacy. See e.g. on these, C. Ernst, The \n \n ¶ \n stages of love in early \n Persian Sufism , in L. Lewisohn (ed.), Classical Persian Sufism , from its origins to \n Rūmī , London 1993, 448-51.",
    "Wad̲j̲d was also intimately connected with the practice of musical audition, samāʿ [ q.v. ], and al-G̲h̲azālī states that “Singing produces a state in the heart which is called wad̲j̲d. In its turn, wad̲j̲d causes the bodily limbs to move, whether the movement is nonrhyt̲h̲mic and the emotion be disorderly, or a rhythmic movement, in which case it is called clapping and dancing” ( Iḥyāʾ ʿulūm al-dīn , Cairo 1346-52/1927-33, ii, 237). Thus the highest state of ecstasy is called wud̲j̲ūd or “existence” itself, to be found through samāʿ . Al-G̲h̲azālī’s philosophical analysis of the nature and place of wad̲j̲d among the mystico-psychological states experienced by Ṣūfīs during their concerts of samāʿ played a central role in subsequent debates on the legality of music and the place of ecstasy in the contemplative disciplines in Islam. An entire book of the Iḥyāʾ is devoted to the defence of samāʿ , the K. Ādāb al-samāʿ wa ’l-wad̲j̲d , thus indicating the important place which rapture had always played in Islamic spirituality. He also enumerates seven reasons why listening to poetry is more conducive to rapture than hearing the cantillation of the Ḳurʾān, substantially because hearers are too habituated to this last to be further stirred by it. Concerning the place of ecstasy in Muslim spiritual life, he says that listening to poetry arouses yearning ( s̲h̲awḳ [ q.v. ]) in the lover of God, leading to mystical states ( aḥwāl ) which are called ecstasy ( Iḥyāʾ , ii, 246-7). At the end of this Book, al-G̲h̲azālī proffers his own definition, based on the opinions of D̲h̲u ’l-Nūn al-Miṣrī [ q.v. ] and others, that “ecstasy consists in a mystical state which is the fruit of samāʿ , it is an infusion of a true, original divine nature, which, following upon samāʿ , the listener ‘found’ ( yad̲j̲iduhu ) in himself ( ibid ., ii, 258)."
