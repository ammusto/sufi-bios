    ", pl. afkār , thought, reflection. The Ḳurʾān employs the 2nd and 5th forms of the root fkr , to urge men “to reflect”. In the vocabulary of falsafa and ʿilm al-kalām , the maṣdar fikr denotes the intellectual faculty in the act of thought, reflecting upon an object of intellection. It is distinguished from idrāk , the intellectual faculty of grasping, of perception. The result of the operation of fikr is expressed by the noun of unity fikra .",
    "In taṣawwuf , fikr is used habitually in contrast to d̲h̲ikr [ q.v. ], recollection. Fikr can thus be translated by reflection or meditation. In the performance of fikr the Ṣūfī, concentrating upon a religious subject, meditates according to a certain progression of ideas or a series of evocations which he assimilates and experiences; in d̲h̲ikr , concentrating on the object recollected—generally a Divine Name—, he allows his field of consciousness to lose itself in this object: hence the importance granted to the technique of repetition, at first verbal, later unspoken. The “meditations” of al-Ḥallād̲j̲ on the “night-journey” and “ascension” ( miʿrād̲j̲ ) of the Prophet, or on the meeting of Moses and Iblīs, can be taken as examples of fikr . Another instance of it will be found in the “scrutiny of conscience” ( ḥisāb ) advocated by al-Muḥāsibī.",
    "The problem of the respective merits of fikr and d̲h̲ikr confronted the Ṣūfīs of the first centuries. Al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī insisted upon fikr . It is, he said, “the mirror which makes you see what good there is in you, and what evil”. The Muʿtazila, the Karrāmiyya and the Imāmiyya taught that reflection must precede recourse to samʿ , scriptural or traditional authority; hence, in their view, the superiority of fikr to d̲h̲ikr . Al-Ḥallād̲j̲, notes L. Massignon, “does not make a decision”: he considers both methods to be legitimate, since both must lead to the Goal, but only on the condition that the “initiate” ( ʿārif ) should not cling to his approach as an end in itself. In a celebrated passage of his meditation on the miʿrād̲j̲ , he speaks of the “garden of d̲h̲ikr” which Muḥammad visited “without deviating”, and of the “process of fikr” which he followed without “passing beyond”.",
    "However, al-Ḥallād̲j̲ also seems to have given his preference to fikr rather than d̲h̲ikr . Some of his texts follow this trend. But it is evident that in these texts fikr must not be rendered solely by “discursive meditation”, the effort of the spirit following the human method of procedure, as distinct from the “passive” state of recollection in prayer. Fikr is clearly distinguished from ḥads , just as reflection is distinguished from an intellectual flash of illumination or intuition. But in the reply of Iblīs to Moses, the Kitāb al-Ṭawāsīn contrasts al-fikra (“pure thought”, following Massignon’s translation) with d̲h̲ikr: \n “O Moses, pure thought ( fikra ) has no need of recollection ( d̲h̲ikr ) ” . The fact is, al-Kalābād̲h̲ī explains in commenting on a phrase of Ḥallād̲j̲, the fruits of d̲h̲ikr are refreshment for the soul, while meditations ( afkār ) guide the initiate towards the single divine majesty, the reverential \n ¶ fear of God, His favours and His gifts. D̲h̲ikr appeals to the organs of the senses (the tongue, the physical heart), fikr purely to intellectual concentration. By means of d̲h̲ikr and its rhythmical use of oral prayers the Ṣūfī is almost certain to succeed in attaining subjective spiritual “states” ( aḥwāl ) ; fikr tends to put him within the possibility of experiencing transcendant truths.",
    "But in the event, it was the superiority of d̲h̲ikr to fikr which was to be most generally affirmed. There was distrust of the illusions which the practice of fikr could engender: as early as the 3rd/9th century, K̲h̲as̲h̲īs̲h̲ Nisaʾī said that, “some, by force of “meditation”, claim to enjoy in this world the spiritual life of God, the angels and the prophets, and to feast with the ḥūris” (quoted and trans. Massignon); whilst d̲h̲ikr , though appealing as it does to the organs of the senses, at least has the merit of depriving the spirit of everything other than the object recollected. Monographs were written on d̲h̲ikr , its techniques and achievements, but not on fikr and its methods.",
    "There remains the fact that the gnostic soarings of those who profess waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd (“Unity of Being”) can be regarded as deriving from a fikr in which the use of typified symbols replaced the “process” of discursive reasoning."
