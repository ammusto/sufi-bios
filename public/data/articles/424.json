    "( a. ), “gesture, sign, indication”, has acquired in rhetoric [see \n badīʿ\n ] the technical meaning of “allusion” but, in its early connotation, a gesture of the hand, a sign of the head, of the elbow, the eyes, the eyebrows etc., is considered by al-Ḏj̲āḥiẓ ( Bayān , i, 80; Ḥayawān , i, 33), together with speech, writing, nuṣba and computation on the fingers [see \n ḥisāb al-ʿaḳd\n where other gestures to indicate numbers are also dealt with], as one of the five methods by which a man may express his thoughts [see \n bayān\n ]. Whether combined with words or not, a gesture ( is̲h̲āra and also īmaʾ ) allows a man to make his meaning clear without revealing his thoughts entirely ( Bayān , i, 77 ff.) and may even be necessary in order to explain the meaning of a concrète idea which is unknown to the listener; it is sometimes more expressive than words, and carries further than the voice; a gracious movement of the hand or the head ( ḥusn al-is̲h̲āra ) elegantly emphasises the expression of an idea, in spite of those who consider that absolute immobility is necessary for dignity ( ḥilm [ q.v. ]). Love poetry often refers to the language of the eyes, which express intimate feelings better, and less dangerously than words; lovers have a complete code, the scope of which is summarised by Ibn Ḥazm ( Ṭawḳ , ch. ix, bāb al-is̲h̲āra bi’l-ʿayn ) thus: [a sign made with the eye] “cuts off and brings together, it promises, it threatens, refuses harshly, fills with contentment, commands and forbids, strikes the servants, warns against the watcher, makes laugh and causes grief, asks and answers, holds back and grants generously” (tr. A. R. Nykl, 44); he describes some of these signs and gives their meaning (“to close the eyelid in a wink signifies consent”, etc.), but admits that the majority of them cannot be described, though he implies that e ver y one should be able to grasp their meaning.",
    "In fact the Arabs considered anyone who did not understand the language of gestures and obliged his interlocutor to express his thoughts in words to be a fool (cf. the proverb: inna man lā yaʿrif al-waḥy \n a \n aḥmaḳ , waḥy / waḥī also meaning sign; see al-Maydānī, i, 15; LA , s.v. WḤY ). They had a collection of signs with their own meaning: agreement, refusal, indifference, etc., which were used in everyday life, and according to contemporary witnesses, the Prophet used to accompany his words with gestures whose meaning was not always clear. There existed also ritual or symbolic gestures made when a contract or an alliance was concluded, when an oath of allegiance was sworn or act of allegiance made, etc., [see \n bayʿa\n ; \n ḥilf al-fuḍūl\n ; \n ṣafaḳa\n ; \n yamīn\n ; etc.]. With the question of the gesture with the uncovered hand is connected that with a staff, the symbol of authority [see \n ʿanaza\n ] held by orators and preachers; al-Ḏj̲āḥiẓ devoted in his Bayān a long section to the manifold ways of using the baton, which also served, together with the whip or the sword, to express threats.",
    "More research needs to be done on the ritual or symbolic gestures, which with the Arabs go back to remote antiquity, to complete and amplify the observations of I. Goldziher and to verify the opinions he has advanced in a number of publications: Orient. St . . . . Th. Noeldeke , Giessen 1906, i, 303 ff.; ZDMG , 1, 495 ff.; Abhand. zur arab. philologie , i, 55-7, ii, p. cv \n ¶ (analysis by G. H. Bousquet, in Arabica , vii (1960), 22-3, viii (1961), 269-72).",
    "The magic value of certain gestures can be detected behind some ḥadīths , in particular the prohibition of using the hand to indicate a flash of lightning (Ibn al-At̲h̲īr, Usd al-g̲h̲āba , v, 266) or of greeting a person with one finger only (al-D̲h̲ahabī, Mīzān , ii, 162), in the same way that it survives for example in the gestures to protect against the evil eye [see \n ʿayn\n ]. As for hid̲j̲āʾ [ q.v. ], I Goldziher points out the imprecatory meaning of the index finger pointing at an enemy, and the importance of this finger in Islamic ritual [see \n tashahhud\n ] where it has acquired the characteristic names of sabbāba , musabbiḥa , muhallila , daʿʿāʾa ; it was thus that the Prophet’s habit of extending the index finger during prayer, after having been interpreted as a, magic survival, became the symbolof the unity of God [see \n ṣalāt\n ]; in the ḳunūt [ q.v. ] the act of raising the hands with the palms turned towards the face was the subject of long discussions by the fuḳahāʾ whereas, in invocation ( duʿāʾ [ q.v. ]), the palm turned towards the sky may have had originally a magic force [on the North African\n fātḥa , of a different type, see fātiḥa ].",
    "Many other gestures have still to be studied, but it is enough to mention here those given above plus a brief reference to the game of “mora” (see G. Lemoine, Les anciens procédés de calcul sur les doigts in REI , 1932/1, 4-8); in this game the partners, facing each other, at a given signal open the fist (or fists), raising whatever number of fingers they choose and speaking at the same time the number indicated by the total number of fingers raised (or else saying simply “odd” or “even”), the winner is the one who has guessed correctly. This process can be used to arrange different types of sharing out, which are known by various names: muḳāraʿa , muk̲h̲ārad̲j̲a , munāhada , musāhama [see \n muk̲h̲ārad̲j̲a\n ]. For ism al-is̲h̲āra \n “demonstrative”, [see \n ism\n ].",
    "The Ṣufīs frequently use the word is̲h̲āra in a very technical sense, but when one attempts to define its meaning exactly, one finds that they give few satisfactory definitions or explanations. “Allusion” or “allusive language” would be a literal translation. But whereas these English words refer to a symbolical language which brings the object to mind by suggestion rather than by direct reference (Mallarmé), the Arabic word does not necessarily have this meaning which the Ṣūfīs prefer to render by the term ramz (pl. rumūz ) (see Lumaʿ of al-Ṭūsī, 338). When the Ṣūfīs call themselves the ahl al-is̲h̲āra (the allusionist school) or when they say that their science consists of ʿulūm al-is̲h̲āra , they are attempting to define not only the way in which they express themselves, but also the content of an experience which can only be evoked by this method. Is̲h̲āra is in this sense the opposite of ʿibāra , not in the way that symbolical language is opposed to “realistic” language or in the way that a parable cannot be translated into abstract language, but in the way that something incommunicable is opposed to something communicable. All knowledge acquired by natural means falls within the domain of the ʿibāra in that it can be “expressed” and communicated to others in their language. In mystical experience, however, the bonds of natural knowledge are burst, and man reaches a new world to which his concepts and words cannot be applied. He can only talk about it by “allusion” ( is̲h̲āra ), that is to say not symbolically, but by approximation, always aware that his language can only really be understood by those who have experienced that of \n ¶ which he talks (al-Kalābād̲h̲ī, Taʿarruf , Cairo ed., 87-9). And thus it is, that by the very nature of the experience, the language of the is̲h̲āra tends, on the one hand, to become an esoteric language not understood by the uninitiated or deliberately made incompréhensible to them, and on the other hand, tends to destroy itself as inadéquate and as a veil between the Ṣūfī and the object of his experience: God. The novice, remarked D̲j̲unayd, must find God at the same time as his allusion, but he who has attained the highest of mystical states ( aḥwāl ) must find God in the abolition of the allusion ( Lumaʿ , 224). And al-Ḥāllad̲j̲: “As long as you attempt an is̲h̲āra , you are not yet a muwaḥḥid ,—not until the moment when God takes over your allusion by annihilating your self-consciousness. Then He leaves neither the subject of the allusion ( mus̲h̲īr ) nor the allusion itself” ( Essai , 361, no. 11).",
    "Is̲h̲āra , which we have just described as the esoteric language of the inexpressible mystical experience, acquired this full and complex meaning about the 3rd/9th century, in the Bag̲h̲dād and Ḵh̲urāsān schools. Previous texts use it differently, in a way related to Ḳurʾānic exegesis. Thus when the Tafsīr attributed to D̲j̲aʿfar al-Ṣādiḳ (died 148/765) says that the Ḳurʾān is at once expression ( ʿibāra ) and allusion ( is̲h̲āra ), that the first is for the vulgar believers and the second for the privileged ( Ḵh̲awāṣṣ ), is̲h̲āra and ʿibāra refer to the ẓāhir and the bāṭin of the Book: the vulgar believer stops at the external beauty of the text, while the privileged goes beyond it towards the interiority of the text, towards the allusion which the heart discovers (see P. Nwyia, Exégèse coranique , 167). The definition of is̲h̲āra given by Ibn ʿArabī should also be noted. Replying to Ḥakīm Tirmid̲h̲i’s question: “What is revelation ( wāhy )?’’, he writes: “It is that in which is born the allusion which replaces the expression ( ʿibāra ) without expression. In the ʿibāra , one “passes” from it to the sense which it aims at; and this is why it is called ʿibāra , passage, while the allusion which is revelation is the very essence of that which is alluded to” ( d̲h̲āt-al-mus̲h̲ār ilayhi ; Ḵh̲atm al-awliyā , ed. O. Yahya, 220). The is̲h̲āra is thus the language which effects the maximum reduction of the distance between the saying and what is said. This is why al-S̲h̲iblī could déclare that the true allusion to God is God Himself, and this allusion éludes the mystic (see Lumaʿ , 223)."
