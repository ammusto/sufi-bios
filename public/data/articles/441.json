    "( a. ), with Waḥdat al-Wud̲j̲ūd , two technical terms of Ṣūfī mysticism.",
    "Waḥdat al-s̲h̲uhūd “the oneness of witnessing” is a doctrine established by S̲h̲ayk̲h̲ Aḥmad Sirhindī [ q.v. ] in response to waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd “the oneness of being” or “the unity of existence”, a term that by his day was identified with the position of Ibn al-ʿArabī [ q.v. ; see also taṣawwuf. 2.]. Most of the secondary literature has assumed that there really is a specific, recognised doctrine known as waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd established by Ibn al-ʿArabī and that waḥdat al-s̲h̲uhūd really does offer an alternative or a corrective to that doctrine. Given the history of the expression and the contexts in which it appeared, however, this assumption is difficult to sustain. The various attempts by scholars to explain waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd by employing labels such as “pantheism” or “esoteric monism” succumb to the same assumption and fail to clarify what exactly was at issue in the texts. In fact, waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd was more an emblem than a doctrine, and if Ibn al-ʿArabī was considered its founder, this simply indicates that his writings mark Ṣūfism’s massive entry into the theoretical discussions of wud̲j̲ūd that before him had been the almost exclusive preserve of the philosophers and the mutakallimūn \n .",
    "The underlying issue is how Islam’s first principle— tawḥīd [ q.v ], the assertion that there is no god but God—is to be understood. Sirhindī makes this explicit by employing the terms tawḥīd-i s̲h̲uhūdī and tawḥīd-i wud̲j̲ūdī , interchangeably with waḥdat-i s̲h̲uhūd and waḥdat-i wud̲j̲ūd \n . The specific form taken by the discussion goes back to the early adoption of the term wud̲j̲ūd to render the Greek idea of “being” or “existence” and is complicated by the literal sense of the verb, as exemplified by Ḳurʾānic usage (e.g. “He\n finds God”, XXIV, 39). The difficulty arises the moment wud̲j̲ūd is ascribed to God, given that it can also be ascribed to everything other than God. If God is wud̲j̲ūd , then nothing else can be considered wud̲j̲ūd in the same sense. It is precisely the status of the “others” that needs to be clarified, and this is a basic issue in Kalām , philosophy, and much of theoretical Ṣūfism.",
    "The authors of the early Ṣūfī manuals, such as al-Ḳus̲h̲ayrī, al-Sarrād̲j̲, and Hud̲j̲wīrī, had the Ḳurʾānic meaning of the term wud̲j̲ūd in mind when they \n ¶ discussed it along with wad̲j̲d and tawād̲j̲ud and considered it a stage on the path in which the “finder” ( wād̲j̲id ) is aware only of God. Ibn al-ʿArabī follows this usage when he defines wud̲j̲ūd as “finding the Real in ecstasy” ( wid̲j̲dān al-ḥaḳḳ fi ’l-wad̲j̲d ) ( Iṣṭilāḥāt al-ṣūfiyya , in Rasāʾil Ibn ʿArabī , Ḥaydarābād 1948, 5; al-Futūḥāt al-makkiyya , Cairo 1911, ii, 133.12, 538.1). Wud̲j̲ūd in this sense is often difficult to differentiate from fanāʾ [ q.v. ]. In Anṣārī’s classic Manāzil al-sāʾirīn , wud̲j̲ūd is made the ninety-sixth of the one hundred stages of the path to God and defined as “achieving the reality of the thing” ( al-ẓafar bi-ḥaḳīḳat al-s̲h̲ayʾ ). In these discussions, s̲h̲uhūd frequently plays a role, and it is not always clear that “witnessing” God means anything other than “finding” God. In offering definitions of wud̲j̲ūd , al-Ḳus̲h̲ayrī provides an early example of many verses that use the two terms as rhymes: “My ‘finding’ [ wud̲j̲ūdī ] is that I absent myself from al-wud̲j̲ūd/ with. what appears to me through al-s̲h̲uhūd” ( Risāla , Cairo 1972, 249). Here, the second wud̲j̲ūd can mean both the awareness of self and the “existence” of the self as seen independent from God, while s̲h̲uhūd clearly means witnessing God. This interpretation is confirmed by al-D̲j̲unayd’s definition of mus̲h̲āhada , a term that is often used interchangeably with s̲h̲uhūd: \n “Finding the Real along with losing you” ( wud̲j̲ūd al-ḥaḳḳ maʿa fuḳdānika \n ; ibid ., 279). These authors frequently discuss the subtle differences between s̲h̲uhūd and kas̲h̲f \n “unveiling”, and Ibn al-ʿArabī can employ both these terms as synonyms for wud̲j̲ūd (see indexes of Chittick, The Sufi \n path of knowledge , Albany 1989; idem, The self-disclosure of God , Albany 1997). In Ibn al-ʿArabī’s voluminous discussions of wud̲j̲ūd , the philosophical/theological meaning usually, but not always, dominates over the Ṣūfī sense of experiential finding, without excluding it.",
    "In tracing the history of the expression waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd , we need to distinguish two basic usages. In the earliest instances, it means waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd al-ḥaḳḳ , “the oneness of the real wud̲j̲ūd” , and indicates the self-evident fact that God’s wud̲j̲ūd is the one and only true wud̲j̲ūd. \n Gradually, it comes to designate a distinctive perspective on the whole of reality, though interpretations of what this perspective implies can disagree sharply. The expression itself is not used by Ibn al-ʿArabī, even though his name eventually became associated with it. He should not be called its supporter unless it is explained in a way that corresponds with his teachings (cf. Chittick, Imaginal \n worlds , Albany 1992, ch. 1). However, these teachings are not easy to explain without distortion, since he speaks from diverse standpoints in keeping with various stations of knowledge achieved on the Ṣūfī path. Some, but not all, of these stations demand that God’s absolute wud̲j̲ūd be seen as obliterating the relative wud̲j̲ūd of all else. For example, he sometimes speaks of ahl al-d̲j̲amʿ wa ’l-wud̲j̲ūd “the people of bringing together and finding”, whom he also calls the “people of One Entity” ( ahl ʿayn wāḥida ; Futūḥāt , iii, 447.18; cf. Chittick, Self-disclosure , 183-4). In the Ṣūfī lexicon, d̲j̲amʿ is contrasted with farḳ \n “separation”, and it denotes seeing all things as brought together through God’s reality. The people of bringing together and finding have been so overcome by the vision of God that they see no separation between him and the things. In effect, they say “All is He” ( hama \n ūst )—the ecstatic and poetical exclamation found as early as Anṣārī and said in the later debates to be the position of waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd. \n But Ibn al-ʿArabī does not consider this sort of vision the highest stage on the path to God, because it amounts to seeing with one eye; with the \n ¶ other eye the true Ṣūfī must also see that all is not He.",
    "If the term waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd had any significance for Ibn al-ʿArabī’s own position, it would have been discussed in the writings of those of his disciples who wrote about theoretical issues, especially Ṣadr al-Dīn Ḳūnawī and ʿAfīf al-Dīn al-Tilimsānī [ q.vv .]. Ḳūnawī does in fact use it on two occasions, but it arises naturally in the course of discussions of waḥda and wud̲j̲ūd , and he attaches no special importance to it. In three works of al-Tilimsānī seen by the present writer, the closest he comes to it is waḥdāniyyat al-wud̲j̲ūd ( S̲h̲arḥ al-asmāʾ al-ḥusnā , commentary on the name al-samīʿ ). Perhaps more significantly, in S̲h̲arḥ fuṣūṣ al-ḥikam , the earliest of the many commentaries written on this famous book, al-Tilimsānī says concerning a passage from the first chapter that Ibn al-ʿArabī is employing philosophical language to allude to al-tawḥīd al-wud̲j̲ūdī . In the passage itself, Ibn al-ʿArabī has made the unremarkable statement that wud̲j̲ūd brings together all “existent things” ( mawd̲j̲ūdāt ). In the one work of his so far printed, S̲h̲arḥ manāzil al-sāʾirīn , al-Tilimsānī often uses the expression al-d̲j̲amʿ wa ’l-wud̲j̲ūd , defining it, in a phrase reminiscent of al-D̲j̲unayd’s definition of mus̲h̲āhada , as “the manifestation [ ẓuhūr ] of the Real’s\n wud̲j̲ūd through the annihilation [ fanāʾ ] of the creature’s wud̲j̲ūd” (ed. Tunis 1989, 462).",
    "What might be considered the earliest instances in which the term waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd designates a distinct position are found in the writings of Ibn al-ʿArabī’s fellow-Murcian Ibn Sabʿīn (d. 669/1270 [ q.v. ]), who was much more conversant with the philosophical tradition. In the most explicit of these, he writes that the ignorant and the common people are dominated by multiplicity, while “the elect ʿulamāʾ are dominated by the root [ aṣl ], which is waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd” ( Rasāʾil Ibn Sabʿīn , Cairo 1965, 194; see also 38, 189, 264, 266). He may be saying here that waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd is a doctrinal position; more likely, he is simply asserting that the elect see all things in terms of tawḥīd , while the common people see dispersion and incoherence. What is new here is not the idea but the expression, and it is not surprising in the context, given the centrality of the term wud̲j̲ūd to philosophy. That this specific expression had no special significance for him is suggested by the fact that he does not mention it in his major work, Budd al-ʿārif though he does insist that wud̲j̲ūd is one (Beirut 1978, esp. 228, 303). Another early use of the term is found in two headings of one of the popularising Persian works of ʿAzīz al-Dīn Nasafī, Kas̲h̲f al-ḥaḳāʾiḳ (written in 680/1281-2), where it designates a doctrine having four different formulations at the hands of two groups of Ṣūfīs, “the people of the fire” ( ahl-i \n nār ) and “the people of the light” ( ahl-i \n nūr \n ; see H. Landolt, La paradoxe de la \n “face de dieu” \n : \n ʿAzīz-e Nasafī ( VII \n e \n /XIII \n e \n siècle ) et le \n “monisme ésotérique” de \n l’Islam , in St . Ir ., xxv [1996], 163-92). The folk of the fire see that the one, true wud̲j̲ūd burns away all “others”, while the folk of the light see that the “others” are rays of wud̲j̲ūd’ s light; these two perspectives correlate with fanāʾ and baḳāʾ . Again, the expression is new but not the ideas.",
    "Perhaps the most telling of the early uses of waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd is by Ḳūnawī’s disciple Saʿīd al-Dīn Farg̲h̲ānī [ q.v. ], who employs it many times in both the Persian and Arabic versions of his commentary on Ibn al-Fāriḍ’s\n al-Tāʾiyya . In this work, which is one of the most detailed and sophisticated discussions of the relevant theoretical issues in this period, waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd is the complement of kat̲h̲rat al-ʿilm and provides a philosophical basis for fanāʾ and baḳāʾ . God’s wud̲j̲ūd \n \n ¶ is one through its necessity, while God’s knowledge is many through its objects; thus the oneness of God’s wud̲j̲ūd and the many-ness of His knowledge are the two principles through which he gives existence to the cosmos ( Mas̲h̲āriḳ al-darārī , Tehran 1979, 344; Muntahā ’l-madārik , Cairo 1293/1876, i, 357). On the side of creation, the soul ( nafs ) manifests the many-ness of knowledge, while the spirit ( rūḥ ) manifests the oneness of wud̲j̲ūd ( Mas̲h̲āriḳ 359; Muntahā , ii, 17). Farg̲h̲ānī is careful to point out that wud̲j̲ūd does not simply mean “existence”, but also the habitude ( malaka ) of wad̲j̲d , that is, finding ( yāft ) one’s inner connection to the world of the spirit’s oneness ( Mas̲h̲āriḳ , 364-5). In the Arabic passage that corresponds to this discussion, he offers what is perhaps the earliest example of the term waḥdat al-s̲h̲uhūd he tells us that the traveller, finding his own spirit, is attracted to “the world of the oneness of true witnessing” ( ʿālam waḥdat al-s̲h̲uhūd al-ḥaḳīḳī ; Muntahā , ii, 21). When the traveller reaches the advanced stages of the path, he undergoes annihilation of the soul, and this is accompanied by a subsistence in which he achieves the witnessing ( s̲h̲uhūd ) of waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd \n . \n This prepares him for the annihilation of the spirit, which yields a subsistence that is accompanied by the witnessing of kat̲h̲rat al-ʿilm . Both modes of subsistence can be called d̲j̲amʿ ( Mas̲h̲āriḳ , 186; Muntahā , i, 226). At a still higher stage, he achieves maḳām d̲j̲amʿ al-d̲j̲amʿ , in which the two earlier stations are harmonised. In the highest stage, aḥadiyyat al-d̲j̲amʿ , which is exclusive to Muḥammad, the two perspectives are seen to be the same ( Mas̲h̲āriḳ , 395-96; Muntahā , ii, 45). The fact that the earlier, Persian version of this work was based on Ḳunawī’s lectures suggests that Ḳūnawi employed these terms in the same way that Farg̲h̲ānī does. Nonetheless, the term waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd itself has not yet gained a special significance, because Farg̲h̲ānī does not always carry it over into the enlarged and thoroughly revised Arabic version of the work.",
    "Despite these usages of the term waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd , it is rarely found in the early texts, and apparently it does not become an issue until Ibn Taymiyya [ q.v. ], who mentions it in the titles of two treatises and attacks it violently, claiming that it asserts the identity of God and creation and that it is nothing but the well-known heresies ḥulūl (“incarnationism”) and ittiḥād (“unificationism”). The major commentators on Ibn al-ʿArabī’s\n Fuṣūṣ —Muʾayyid al-Dīn D̲j̲andī, ʿAbd al-Razzāḳ Kās̲h̲ānī, and Dāwūd al-Ḳayṣarī—do not mention it, but, by the 9th/15th century, it was controversial. D̲j̲āmī in Nafaḥāt al-uns (completed in 883/1478) writes that the exchange of letters between ʿAlāʾ al-Dawla Simnānī and Kās̲h̲ānī in the early 8th/14th century had to do with waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd , and this has led modern scholars to treat the debate in the same terms, even though the two authors do not mention waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd in the letters, nor, it seems, in any of their other writings (see H. Landolt, Der Briefwechsel \n zwischen \n Kāšānī \n und \n Simnānī über \n Waḥdat al-Wuǧūd, in Isl , 1 [1973], 29-81).",
    "Sirhindī’s reaction to waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd occurs in the context of its relatively new-found fame and its general ascription to Ibn al-ʿArabī. He objects to it, he says, because a large number of his contemporaries were employing it as a pretext to avoid observing the rulings of the S̲h̲arīʿa (e.g. Maktūbāt , Dihlī 1964, no. 43). In explaining its meaning, he demonstrates little acquaintance with the writings of Ibn al-ʿArabī or the major figures who discussed the issues. By insisting that a correct interpretation of waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd demands that it mean waḥdat al-s̲h̲uhūd , he was saying that the \n ¶ \n wud̲j̲ūd of the world is not identical with the wud̲j̲ūd of God in every sense—despite the current rhetoric of “All is He”—and that if certain genuine Ṣūfīs had considered the wud̲j̲ūd of God and the world to be the same, this goes back to their witnessing, not to the actual situation. At least partly because wud̲j̲jūd in his understanding had none of the earlier connotations of finding, he felt it necessary to insist that seeing God in all things goes back to the viewer and does not offer a final explanation of the nature of reality. In any case, most Ṣūfī theoreticians in India ignored or dismissed his objections, while others felt it necessary to point out that he really did not disagree with Ibn al-ʿArabī (e.g. S̲h̲āh Walī Allāh, in his well-known Fayṣala-yi waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd wa ’l-s̲h̲uhūd ). It is only in the modern period that Sirhindī has been elevated to special rank by historians of Islamic India (see Y. Friedmann, S̲h̲ayk̲h̲ Aḥmad Sirhindī . An outline of his thought and a study of his image in the eyes of posterity , Montreal and London 1971).",
    "Finally, we should keep in mind that the Muslim authors themselves had no interest in the history of ideas in the modern sense. For Sirhindī, waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd was a living issue, and it was not important to know exactly how it had come upon the scene. He saw that his contemporaries ascribed the expression to Ibn al-ʿArabī and, like Ibn Taymiyya, he thought that they understood it to mean the absolute identity of God and creation. Thus although his interpretation of waḥdat al-wud̲j̲ūd exhibits no understanding of the subtleties of Ibn al-ʿArabī’s position or of the various meanings that had been given to the term over the centuries, it does reflect the status of ongoing debates on tawḥīd , the most basic of theoretical issues in Islamic thought."
