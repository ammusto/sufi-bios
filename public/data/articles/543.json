    "al-Anṭākī , Abū ʿAbd Allāh (or Abū ʿAlī) Aḥmad b. ʿĀṣim, was a famous mystic of the 2nd/8th and 3rd/9th centuries. While the exact date and place of his birth are not known, both his nisba and the fact that he was said to be from the frontier lands ( thughūr ) suggest that he was born in Antioch; he also spent some time in Damascus (Ibn Ḥibbān, 8/20; Anṣārī, 123; Ibn al-ʿAdīm, 2/848; see Yāqūt, 2/79–80; Ibn Manẓūr, 3/127; al-Dhahabī, Taʾrīkh , 43; see also Ibn Abī Ḥātim, 1(1)/66). Al-Anṭākī became proficient in the standard disciplines of the time, but was to be best known for his attachment to ascetic practices and his mastery of practical and theoretical mysticism (see e.g. Abū Nuʿaym, 9/280–289; al-Hujwīrī, 159; Ibn Kathīr, 10/318; also ʿAṭṭār, 410); his acute awareness and penetrating discernment earned him the sobriquet ‘spy of hearts’ ( jāsūs al-qulūb ) (al-Qushayrī, 19; ʿAṭṭār, 410; Ibn al-ʿAdīm, 2/848).",
    "Aḥmad al-Anṭākī was a companion of the leading Sufis and ascetics of his day, including Bishr al-Ḥāfī (d. 277/890), Sarī al-Saqaṭī (d. 283/867), and perhaps al-Fuḍayl b. ʿIyāḍ (d. 187/803) (al-Sulamī, 127; al-Qushayrī, 19; al-Hujwīrī, 159). According to Jāmī (p. 91), he was a disciple of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī (d. 243/857).",
    "His own disciples included Aḥmad b. Abī al-Ḥawārī, the well-known 2nd–3rd/8th–9th century Syrian mystic, who transmitted many of his master’s teachings (e.g. see al-Sulamī, 129; Abū Nuʿaym, 9/281, 282, 293, 295–296; al-Bayhaqī, 199, 358; al-Qushayrī, 90, 155). Al-Anṭākī was also a scholar of ḥadīth , having heard ḥadīth s from the traditionists of Baghdad and Damascus; and others transmitted them from him (see e.g. Ibn Abī Ḥātim, 1(1)/66; Ibn Ḥibbān, 8/20; Ibn al-ʿAdīm, 2/848; al-Dhahabī, Taʾrīkh , 43; idem, Siyar , 11/409).",
    "Some authorities propose the year 215/830 as his date of death (Massignon, Essai , 223; Brockelmann, SI/351; Sezgin, 1/638), Ibn Kathīr, however, suggests a date closer to 239/854 (10/318–319), and al-Dhahabī also thinks it probable that he lived until at least 230/845 ( Siyar , 11/409, 10/488).",
    "From sayings ascribed to al-Anṭākī we know that his teachings dealt with many fundamental mystical and ethical concepts, including gnosis ( maʿrifa ), poverty ( faqr ), endurance ( ṣabr ), honesty ( ṣidq ), certainty ( yaqīn ), fear ( khawf ), and hope ( rajāʾ ) (see e.g. al-Sulamī, 127–130; Abū Nuʿaym, 9/280–296; Ibn al-Jawzī, 4/277–279; Ibn Manẓūr, 3/127–129).",
    "Works",
    "None of al-Anṭākī’s works are extant as such; most of his teachings are preserved in the form of quotations in biographical dictionaries and Sufi texts. His teachings have a special importance in that they date from the earliest phase of asceticism and Sufism in Islam. Massignon believes that his writings preceded those of al-Muḥāsibī and that the latter drew upon al-Anṭākī’s works in his own. The following writings are attributed to al-Anṭākī.",
    "Al-Anṭākī also composed poetry, some of which is still extant (Abū Nuʿaym, 9/296–297; Ibn al-ʿAdīm, 2/852; Ibn Manẓūr, 3/130; Ibn Kathīr, 10/318)."
