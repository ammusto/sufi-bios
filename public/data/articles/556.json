    "al-Ḥallāj , Abū ʿAbd Allāh, Ḥusayn b. Manṣūr b. Maḥmī (or Muḥammī) al-Fārisī al-Bayḍāwī (d. 24 Dhū al-Qaʿda 309/26 March 922), one of the most famous and eminent Sufi gnostics. His teachings on mystical love exercised an influence far beyond his own time and place, and his fame has exceeded that of many of his contemporaries, not least because of his violent end (see al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , 308; al-Hujwīrī, 229; ʿAṭṭār, Tadhkira , 583; Shūshtarī, 2/36; see also Schimmel, 173; Nicholson, ‘Ḥallāj’, 480).",
    "Al-Ḥallāj has been a figure of great interest to chroniclers and biographers throughout Islamic history, and many accounts of his life and teachings may be found in works on mysticism and on history. Nonetheless, it remains difficult to draw firm conclusions about him because of his complex personality, ecstatic states, unorthodox utterances, and disordered (and sometimes disparate or contradictory) corpus of writings, in addition to the social and political circumstances in which he lived.",
    "The variety of sources for the life, personality, and teachings of al-Ḥallāj clearly demonstrates his importance and significance for the mystical tradition. They can be divided into two broad types: Sufi and historical. The majority of the first kind are hagiographical; they focus on his eminence as a saint and gnostic, bestowing lofty titles upon him, and offer a mystical interpretation of the events described by historians. In doing so, they defend his unorthodox behaviour and sayings, arguing that these were the result of ecstatic states beyond his control (al-Hujwīrī, 232; al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , 308; ʿAyn al-Quḍāt, 235; Ibn Khallikān, 2/140). On the other hand, historians and chroniclers have tended to portray al-Ḥallāj as a charlatan and a heretic.",
    "BIOGRAPHY",
    "The oldest and arguably most significant sources available on al-Ḥallāj’s life, utterances, and teachings, are the Akhbār al-Ḥallāj , as narrated by his son; Dhikr akhbār al-Ḥallāj ilā ḥīna maqtalih by Ismāʿīl b. Muḥammad b. al-Zanjī (known as Ibn al-Zanjī), the scribe for the court of redress ( maẓālim ) in Baghdad, who composed this work fifteen years after al-Ḥallāj was executed; Bidāyat ḥāl al-Ḥallāj wa nihāyatuh by Ibn Bākūya Shīrāzī, which appears to have been part of a larger work, Akhbār al-ʿārifīn or Ḥikāyāt al-ṣūfiyya (see Shams, 691); and the Taʾrīkh Baghdād of al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī, which provides a relatively full early account of Ḥallāj’s life (8/112–141). Al-Ḥallāj was also one of the first Sufis to have received attention from Western scholars and he sparked considerable interest in the broader study of Sufism. The most detailed and significant academic work on al-Ḥallāj is Louis Massignon’s La passion de Husayn ibn Mansûr Hallâj . Massignon also edited and published al-Ḥallāj’s Ṭawāsīn and his Dīwān (Sezgin, 1/651–653; Schimmel, 176). One of the most prominent European orientalists, Massignon devoted much of his later life, after ‘discovering’ al-Ḥallāj, to researching and writing on him; for Massignon, as a martyr to divine love al-Ḥallāj represented an almost Christ-like figure.",
    "Information about al-Ḥallāj’s origins is sparse and contradictory. His grandfather, named either Muḥammī or Maḥmī, may have been a Zoroastrian. It is said that he was a descendant of the prominent Companion of the Prophet Muḥammad and Imam ʿAlī (q.v.), Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī (q.v.) (al-Khaṭīb, 8/112; Ibn Khallikān, 2/144; al-Dhahabī, Siyar , 14/313–314; idem, al-ʿIbar , 2/144; Surūr, 38; see also Massignon, La passion , 1/139; Zarrīnkūb, 131–132). His kunya is sometimes given as Abū Ṭāhir, and also Abū ʿAmmāra, Abū Muḥammad or Abū Masʿūd (Ibn Nadīm, 269; Zarrīnkūb, 132–133). Some believe that al-Ḥallāj had two names: Ḥusayn b. Manṣūr and Muḥammad b. Aḥmad al-Fārisī (see Abū ʿAlī Miskawayh, 5/133; al-Khaṭīb, 8/134; cf. Ibn Kathīr, 11/142, who also gives him the name Muḥammad b. Ḥusayn), although Zarrīnkūb argues that Muḥammad b. Aḥmad al-Fārisī was an alias that al-Ḥallāj adopted when he was in hiding.",
    "There are also several theories as to how he came to be known as ‘al-Ḥallāj’ (meaning ‘cotton-carder’): the first is simply that this was his father’s trade; it has also been claimed that when he was in a cotton workshop in Wāsiṭ, he was able to separate a great many cotton fibres from their seeds with a single gesture, to the amazement of those who were present; yet another account holds that it was his ability to uncover secrets and read people’s minds that earned him the title ‘Ḥallāj al-Asrār’ (‘the carder of secrets’), which was then shortened to ‘al-Ḥallāj’ (Massignon, Akhbār , 89; al-Khaṭīb, 8/114; al-Anṣārī, Ṭabaqāt , 380, 384; al-Samʿānī, ʿAbd al-Karīm, 11/133; ʿAṭṭār, Tadhkira , 586; Ibn Khallikān, 2/146; al-Dhahabī, Siyar , 12/316; Ibn Kathīr, 11/143; Jāmī, Nafaḥāt , 153; Massignon, La passion , 1/142–143; cf. Nicholson, ‘Ḥallāj’, 481).",
    "Al-Ḥallāj was born in 244/859 in the village of Ṭūr, to the northeast of Bayḍāʾ, a dependency of Fārs. In the early years of his life, his father Manṣūr, a cotton-carder, travelled to Khūzistān where there was a thriving textile industry. Later he plied his trade in Tustar (Shūshtar) before moving on to Wāsiṭ in 255/869 when al-Ḥallāj was eleven years of age. Most inhabitants of Wāsiṭ at this time were followers of the Sunni Ḥanbalī school, and only a few of the surrounding villages harboured Shiʿi sympathies. It was here that al-Ḥallāj spent his formative years (al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , 308; al-Khaṭīb, 8/112; al-Anṣārī, Ṭabaqāt , 380; Ibn al-Jawzī, al-Muntaẓam , 13/201; al-Dhahabī, Siyar , 14/314–315; Ibn Mulaqqin, 187; Massignon, La passion , 1/99; Nicholson, ‘Ḥallāj’, 481; see also Ibn al-Nadīm, 269–270 and Ibn al-ʿIbrī, 156, who suggest a different location for his birth and upbringing).",
    "Al-Ḥallāj received his early religious education in an environment predisposed to Ḥanbalī teachings. He began with the memorisation of the Qurʾān and preliminary studies, which he completed when he was sixteen years of age (in 260/874). Thereafter, he went to Tustar and became a disciple of Sahl b. ʿAbd Allāh al-Tustarī (d. 283/896 or 286/899), receiving his initiation into Sufism through this school of thought which focused on self-mortification and severe spiritual struggle, although he did not receive al-Tustarī’s khirqa (spiritual mantle). In spite of this, the biographies of al-Ḥallāj suggest that he later returned to the mystical approach of al-Tustarī, engaging in extremely difficult spiritual exercises (see al-Daylamī, Sīra , 97–98; al-Khaṭīb, 8/112; al-Hujwīrī, 230, 443; ʿAṭṭār, Tadhkira , 585–586; Ibn Khallikān, 2/141; al-Dhahabī, Siyar , 14/314; Massignon, La passion , 1/104; Zarrīnkūb, 133–135).",
    "He spent two years in the company of Sahl al-Tustarī and even accompanied him into exile in Baṣra in 262/876. In Baṣra, al-Ḥallāj became a disciple of ʿAmr b. ʿUthmān al-Makkī (d. 297/910). After about a year and a half of spiritual practice with him, he received his khirqa . Thereafter, in 264/878, aged twenty, he married the daughter of the Sufi master Abū Yaʿqūb al-Aqṭaʿ. She was known as Umm al-Ḥusayn and bore him a daughter and three sons, two of whom were named Sulaymān and Ḥamd. It appears that his marriage to the daughter of Abū Yaʿqūb displeased his teacher ʿAmr b. ʿUthmān, because one account states that it led to a disagreement between the two men (Abū ʿAlī Miskawayh, 5/134; al-Khaṭīb, 8/112; ʿAṭṭār, Tadhkira , 585; al-Dhahabī, Siyar , 14/315; idem, al-ʿIbar , 2/146; Zarrīnkūb, 135; Massignon, La passion , 1/105–107; Nicholson, ‘Ḥallāj’, 481; Mason, 3; al-Shaybī, ‘Ḥallāj’, 22). ʿAmr b. ʿUthmān al-Makkī and Abū Yaʿqūb al-Aqṭaʿ, already rivals for the leadership of the Sufis in Baṣra, now also vied for the loyalty of al-Ḥallāj. However, according to the Akhbār al-Ḥallāj (p. 38), it seems that it was al-Ḥallāj’s disagreeable behaviour towards ʿAmr b. ʿUthmān al-Makkī that turned his teacher against him. Massignon believes that Abū Yaʿqūb’s daughter, Umm al-Ḥusayn, was associated with the Karnabāʾī family, a Shiʿi family from Tustar with connections to the Zanj uprising, and al-Ḥallāj may have also had connections to this group which sympathised with the rebels (Massignon, La passion , 1/103–105; Mason, 5–6).",
    "In any case, al-Ḥallāj remained in Baṣra until the conflict between Abū Yaʿqūb and ʿAmr b. ʿUthmān became too much for him to bear. In 264/878, he left the city for Baghdad, where he joined the circle of al-Junayd. Although al-Junayd asked him to have some consideration for his teacher, al-Ḥallāj opted to remain in Baghdad and joined the circle of al-Junayd’s disciples, coming into contact with some of the greatest Sufis of the day, including Abū al-Ḥusayn al-Nūrī (d. 295/908), before receiving a khirqa from al-Junayd himself (al-Khaṭīb, 8/112; Ibn al-Jawzī, al-Muntaẓam , 13/201; al-Dhahabī, Siyar , 14/314; Ibn Taghrībirdī, 3/202; see also Zarrīnkūb, 135). During this time he may have also encountered Abū Bakr al-Fuwaṭī (d. 320/932) (al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , 308; al-Anṣārī, Ṭabaqāt , 380).",
    "According to al-Hujwīrī, al-Ḥallāj had debates with al-Junayd about Sufi sobriety ( ṣaḥw ) and intoxication ( sukr ) (p. 285), although these discussions probably date to al-Ḥallāj’s second encounter with al-Junayd in 271/885. Some scholars have argued that, owing to al-Junayd’s eminent position within Sufism, al-Ḥallāj’s real initiation onto the spiritual path should be considered to date to his time with him in Baghdad (see Zarrīnkūb, 135; see also ʿAṭṭār, Tadhkira , 585).",
    "Al-Ḥallāj remained in al-Junayd’s circle for around six years and maintained relations with him for the next two decades. After leaving al-Junayd’s circle, al-Ḥallāj travelled to Tustar and in 270/883—the year in which the Zanj rebellion was defeated —set off on the ḥ ajj pilgrimage, spending a year in spiritual retreat in the environs of the Holy Sanctuary in Mecca, where he engaged in worship, self-mortification, fasting, and periods of silence. It is said that he acquired a large following during this period of his life. In 271/884, al-Ḥallāj returned to the circle of al-Junayd in Baghdad. According to al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī (8/112–113), he now began to expound his own ideas and interpretations of the mystical path (possibly including the theory of the essential union, or ʿayn al-jamʿ  ). Some of his earliest ecstatic utterances ( sha ṭ ḥiyyāt ) appear to date from this period and they must have been what aroused al-Junayd’s displeasure with al-Ḥallāj. His teacher condemned him, harshly forbade him from discussing such matters, and warned him of the dire consequences of doing so (see Massignon, Akhbār , 38; ʿAṭṭār, Tadhkira , 585; al-Dhahabī, Siyar , 14/315; see also Shaybī, ‘Ḥallāj’, 23; Massignon, La passion , 1/145–146; Schimmel, 173).",
    "Al-Junayd’s censure of al-Ḥallāj may have also been what led other Sufi leaders, including his former teacher, ʿAmr b. ʿUthmān al-Makkī, and his father in-law, Abū Yaʿqūb al-Aqṭaʿ, to openly disassociate themselves from him and condemn his teachings. With this began a period in which al-Ḥallāj spent most of his time travelling from one place to another in different regions of the Muslim lands, one in which his biographers described him as being a ‘frequent traveller and wayfarer’ ( akthara al-irtiḥāl wa al-asfār ) (see Massignon, Akhbār , 38; al-Khaṭīb, 8/121–122; al-Dhahabī, Siyar , 14/314).",
    "After al-Ḥallāj broke from al-Junayd, he returned to Tustar. While he was well-received in the city, al-Makkī’s opposition to him meant that he could not remain there for more than a year and had to associate with the landed aristocracy, senior bureaucrats, and other rich and powerful benefactors, most of whom were Shiʿi, after he exchanged his khirqa for a robe ( qabā ), which he may have done as a mark of protest. In around 274/887, when he was thirty years of age, al-Ḥallāj was arrested and pilloried in the Jabal/Jibāl region, which lies between Shūsh and Wāsiṭ, on charges of being an agent of the Qarmaṭīs (possibly also because of his past associations with the Zanj revolt). In 275/888, he left this region and spent five years travelling around Khurāsān, Transoxania, Sīstān, Kirmān, Fārs and other regions, where he enjoyed greater freedom to preach and teach. According to certain sources, it was during this period that he began composing written works (see al-Khaṭīb, 8/113; al-Anṣārī, Ṭabaqāt , 337; ʿAṭṭār, Tadhkira , 585–586; al-Dhahabī, Siyar , 14/315; Ibn Taghrībirdī, 3/202; Massignon, La passion , 1/178, marginal notes; Mason, 9–12).",
    "At the end of his travels, al-Ḥallāj came back to Tustar, and then, around 280/893, returned to his family in Ahwāz. It was probably around 281/894 that his third son, Ḥamd, was born. Also dated to around this time are a range of charismatic acts ( karāmāt ) he performed, such as mind-reading and the divulging of secrets, feats which earned him the title ‘the carder of secrets’ ( ḥallāj al-asrār ) or ‘the carder of hearts’ ( ḥallāj al-qulūb ) (al-Khaṭīb, 8/113; ʿAṭṭār, Tadhkira , 585–586; cf. al-Dhahabī, Siyar , 14/315, who dates these acts to the period of his travels to different lands). In 281/894, al-Ḥallāj set off for Baṣra and, accompanied by a large band of disciples, donned the patchwork clothes of mendicants ( muraqqaʿ ) and then left for Mecca. Sources say that it was on this journey that a number of Sufis, including Abū Yaʿqūb Nahrajūrī (d. 330/942), accused him of being a sorcerer, swindler, and one who consorts with jinn (Massignon, Akhbār , 40–41; al-Khaṭīb, 8/118; al-Hujwīrī, 229; al-Dhahabī, Siyar , 14/315; see also Shūshtarī, 2/36; Zarrīnkūb, 141–142).",
    "From Mecca, al-Ḥallāj returned to Ahwāz and Tustar before setting off again for Baghdad in the company of his family and a number of notables from Ahwāz; he stayed a year in Baghdad. During his time in the city, al-Ḥallāj spent time with Abū Bakr al-Shiblī and, once again, Abū al-Ḥusayn al-Nūrī. Thereafter, he set out alone on his second period of travels, which was arguably both his most important set of journeys and his longest, spanning a total of five years. Once again, he travelled to the eastern regions of the Muslim world, including Khurāsān and Transoxania, before taking a boat to India, where he visited Gujarat, Sindh, Punjab, Multan and Kashmir. On his travels, he also visited Turkestan and various cities in Iran, including Iṣfahān and Qumm. This gave him the opportunity to preach to a variety of people, including Turks, Uyghurs and the peoples of Northwest India. The substance of his preaching seems to have focused on monotheism and divine love. During his time in Qumm, he had interactions with Imāmī scholars. Some sources say that when he was there he began summoning people to ‘the One Agreed Upon from Muḥammad’s Family’ ( al-riḍā min āl Muḥammad ), however he failed to establish a following there and it seems that after meeting him the Imāmī scholars accused him of claiming to be the Mahdī or a form of divine lordship. In Iṣfahān, ʿAlī b. Sahl al-Iṣfahānī (d. 307/919) accused al-Ḥallāj of being a heretic after the latter criticised him and roused people against him (Massignon, Akhbār , 38; al-Daylamī, Sīra , 98–100; Ibn Nadīm, 269–270; al-Khaṭīb, 8/120 et passim; Ibn al-Jawzī, al-Muntaẓam , 13/202, 204; see also Massignon, La passion , 1/212–213, 370–372; Mason, 14–15; Schimmel, 173–174; Zarrīnkūb, 133, 136–137, 141–142).",
    "It is most likely that al-Ḥallāj also visited Kūfa during this period, where we are told he stayed in the house of the Shiʿi mystic Muḥammad b. Ḥasan al-ʿAlawī, and met Ibrāhīm Khawwāṣ (d. 291/904) (al-Hujwīrī, 308–309, 417; al-Shaybī, Tashayyuʿ , 65; regarding his meeting Ibrāhīm Khawwāṣ, see al-Qushayrī, 165; Najm al-Dīn, 202).",
    "Al-Ḥallāj’s critics accused him of learning sorcery from the followers of religious groups he had encountered in India. They even claimed that the light of his faith had been extinguished by what they perceived to be the prevalent disbelief there (al-Khaṭīb, 8/120–121; al-Dhahabī, Siyar , 14/318–319; idem, al-ʿIbar , 2/144; Ibn Kathīr, 11/143) Be that as it may, his interactions with the Shiʿis of various regions do appear to have influenced his beliefs about the Mahdi. For instance, in Ṭāliqān, Khurāsān, he spoke about the imminent appearance of the imam. His familiarity with both the Zanj rebels and the independent Zaydī state in Ṭabaristān undoubtedly exerted some influence on his political leanings (al-Baghdādī, 247; al-Shaybī, al-Ṣila , 404; idem, ‘Ḥallāj’, 25–26, 29; Zarrīnkūb, 136–141; see also Iqbāl Āshtiyānī, 111–116).",
    "In about 290/903, al-Ḥallāj returned to Baghdad, donned his mendicant’s robes once more, and set off for Mecca to make his third pilgrimage. His son, Ḥamd, said that on this journey of more than two years, al-Ḥallāj underwent an almost total change in his behaviour and speech (al-Khaṭīb, 8/114; Ibn al-Jawzī, al-Muntaẓam , 13/202). Upon his return from this pilgrimage in 293/905, he built himself a model representation of the Kaʿba in his own home, began praying in the graveyard by night, and proclaimed his yearning for God in the streets and marketplaces during the day. It is perhaps during this time that he also uttered his (in)famous dictum: ‘I am the Truth’ ( an ā al- Ḥ aqq ) in response to Abū Bakr al-Shiblī who asked him about his condition ( a ḥ w ā l ) in the Mosque of al-Manṣūr. He would tell friends and strangers alike: ‘Kill me! Surely my life is in my being killed ( uqtulūnī yā thiqātī / inna fī qatlī ḥayātī ) ( Dīwān al-Ḥallāj , ed. Saʿdī Ḍannāwī, 31).",
    "At the same time as the ʿAbbāsid government was teetering under the leadership of al-Muqtadir (r. 295–320/908–932), he began to proclaim his theopathic utterances more openly and perform saintly miracles in public gatherings. While this roused popular excitement and won him a following, it also cost him the support of leading Sufis, such as Abū Bakr al-Shiblī, and drew the ire of more exoterically-minded religious scholars and jurists. For example, the prominent Muʿtazilī theologian Abū ʿAlī al-Jubbāʾī (d. 303/916) derided al-Ḥallāj’s pronouncements and claims as trickery, while the well-known jurist of the Ẓāhirī school, Muḥammad b. Dāwūd al-Ẓāhirī (known as Ibn Dāwūd al-Iṣfahānī) (d. 296/909), openly denounced him, accusing him of believing in incarnation and union with the divine ( ḥulūl ), and hence of being an apostate who deserved capital punishment.",
    "However, Abū al-ʿAbbās Aḥmad b. ʿUmar, known as Ibn al-Surayj (d. 306/919), the eminent Shāfiʿī jurist of Baghdad who appears to have held some Sufi inclinations, publicly rejected this opinion and saved al-Ḥallāj’s life. Later he described al-Ḥallāj as a pious and learned individual whose sayings could not easily be understood. Equally, in defence of al-Ḥallāj’s utterances, he asserted that the sharīʿa contained no law against ecstatic statements made in a state of mystical stupor, and that dealing with such accusations was outside the authority of the courts. According to Ibn al-Surayj, these utterances, while outwardly heretical, could not be taken as a reliable indication of al-Ḥallāj’s real beliefs and, therefore, no ruling could be issued against him on that basis  (Massignon, Akhbār , 7–8, 38, 106–107; al-Baghdādī, 247–249; al-Khaṭīb, 8/114; Ibn al-Jawzī, Talbīs , 172; idem, al-Muntaẓam , 13/203; Ibn Khallikān, 2/144–145; al-Dhahabī, Siyar , 14/323; idem, al-ʿIbar , 2/149; Jāmī, Nafaḥāt , 153; Massignon, La passion , 1/386, marginal notes, and p. 416 marginal notes; see also Mason, 17–18 who dates Ibn Dāwūd’s condemnation and Ibn Surayj’s defence to just before the third ḥajj and just after his return from it).",
    "The ʿAbbāsid court also took an interest in the affairs of al-Ḥallāj during this period. At the time of these events, the ʿAbbāsid regime was facing numerous challenges, both internal and external, and any political, social, or religious debate invariably found its way to the court. During his reign, al-Muqtadir appointed no fewer than twelve chief ministers, an indication of the inefficiency and instability at the heart of government. In 296/909, at the direction of Ḥusayn b. Ḥamdān and probably under the influence of ʿAbbās b. al-Ḥasan, al-Muqtadir’s chief minister at the time, a group of mostly Ḥanbalī Sunnis for whom al-Ḥallāj was a spiritual leader overthrew al-Muqtadir and installed ʿAbd Allāh b. al-Muʿtazz (d. 296/908), an influential poet of the ʿAbbāsid family, as the new caliph. Their victory was short-lived: within a day Ibn al-Muʿtazz had been arrested and executed and al-Muqtadir restored as caliph. Al-Ḥallāj was now a target for the ʿAbbāsid government, especially for the Shiʿi vizier, Ibn al-Furāt. He was forced to flee to Tustar and to go into hiding, and several of al-Ḥallāj’s allies were kept under watch and harassed or imprisoned (Mason, 19–20).",
    "According to Muḥammad Zanjī, a court scribe who later witnessed the trial of al-Ḥallāj, two of al-Ḥallāj’s disciples, Ḥammād al-Dabbās and Abū ʿAlī Hārūn b. ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz al-Awārijī, betrayed him to the authorities. They divulged his secrets, provided copies of his writings, and played on the sensitivities of al-Muqtadir, who instructed his minister, ʿAlī b. ʿĪsā al-Jarrāḥ to investigate the matter. This resulted in the detention of a number of al-Ḥallāj’s students and supporters, whose confessions stated that he claimed to be God and that he brought the dead back to life. For three years, al-Ḥallāj remained in hiding in Tustar, Shūsh, and other localities in Khūzistān, until on 25 Rabīʿ I 301/25 October 913, Abū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī b. Aḥmad al-Rāsibī, the master of the postal and intelligence service of Wāsiṭ and Ahwāz, discovered al-Ḥallāj’s whereabouts and apprehended him. Al-Rāsibī placed al-Ḥallāj upside down on a camel and sent him to Baghdad escorted by a crier denouncing him as a Qarmaṭī agent.",
    "Al-Ḥallāj was imprisoned, tortured, and tried. During the trial he denied all the charges against him, and by insisting that he was an orthodox Muslim, he was able to escape the more serious charge of apostasy (Ibn Nadīm, 269–271; Abū ʿAlī Miskawayh, 5/133; al-Khaṭīb, 8/132–134; Ibn al-Jawzī, Talbīs , 172; idem, al-Muntaẓam , 13/204; Ibn Khallikān, 2/142; Ibn al-Athīr, 8/127; al-Dhahabī, Siyar , 2/147; al-Shaybī, ‘Ḥallāj’, 30). Al-Jarrāḥ ordered that al-Ḥallāj have his beard shaved off and be publicly pilloried on the main bridge of Baghdad for three days with a sign above his head, and a crier beside him, denouncing him as a Qarmaṭī missionary, before being imprisoned once again (Ibn Nadīm, 270; al-Dhahabī, Siyar , 14/327; Ibn Taghrībirdī, 3/182; also cf. Shaybī, ‘Ḥallāj’, 30-31; Mason, 20–21; Zarrīnkūb, 144).",
    "The accusation of being a Qarmaṭī might have arisen against al-Ḥallāj simply because his enemies wanted to associate him with a group that was widely despised and to thereby deprive him of his popular appeal. Al-Shaybī also argues that al-Ḥallāj may have been saved by the accusation that he was a Qarmaṭī agent because the Fāṭimids had just launched an attack against Alexandria and the Qarmaṭīs had just brokered a truce with the ʿAbbāsids who did not want to risk a fresh Qarmaṭī uprising while beset by internal divisions and a more serious external threat ( al-Ṣila , 399–400).",
    "The details of al-Ḥallāj’s life during his final imprisonment in Baghdad are not clear. The accounts suggest that he was imprisoned for about nine years (301–309/914–923). During this time, he continued to preach and teach amongst his fellow inmates. According to the Akhbār al-Ḥallāj and al-Daylamī’s Sīrat al-Shaykh al-Kabīr , during his time in prison al-Ḥallāj was fully occupied with guiding other prisoners and ‘enjoining good and forbidding evil’. His performance of saintly miracles appears to have endeared him to his fellow inmates, adding to the ranks of his disciples and devotees. While he was in prison, the guards and even members of the court were inclined towards him and believed that he had the power to raise the dead and command the jinn . Ḥamd al-Qunnāʾī, a court scribe, Naṣr al-Qushūrī, the caliph’s chamberlain ( ḥājib ), and al-Muqtadir’s mother, Shaghab, were all thought to have been his supporters. Al-Qunnāʾī allegedly believed in his divinity, while Shaghab believed he could perform miracles and heal the sick, as she was convinced that his supplications had cured both herself and her son of illness. Naṣr al-Qushūrī held al-Ḥallāj in high esteem and arranged the marriage of the latter’s son to his daughter. It was also he who pleaded with the caliph to build a large home for al-Ḥallāj to reside in beside the prison. Thanks to his influential supporters, al-Ḥallāj enjoyed relatively more freedom from this time onwards and was better able to spread his teachings. It was probably during this period that he developed closer relationships with his adherents at court, for whom he composed written works.",
    "There are reports to the effect that he dedicated a work entitled al-Siyāsa wa al-khulafāʾ to the caliph al-Muqtadir, another called al-Durra to Naṣr Qushūrī, and al-Siyāsa to Ḥusayn b. Ḥamdān, the caliph’s chief lieutenant. In 303/916 he cured the caliph of an illness. However it was also during this period (304–306/916–919) that Ibn al-Furāt, al-Ḥallāj’s implacable foe, once again became prominent and replaced ʿAlī b. ʿĪsā as chief minister. Having regained his position of influence, Ibn al-Furāt sought to bring al-Ḥallāj to trial once more; but the caliph’s mother and his supporters at court intervened on his behalf, and Ibn al-Furāt was unsuccessful (Massignon, Akhbār , 90–91; Ibn Nadīm, 271; al-Daylamī, Sīra , 93–95; al-Khaṭīb, 8/136; al-Anṣārī, Ṭabaqāt , 384; Ibn Kathīr, 6/150–152; see also Massignon, La passion , 1/446; al-Shaybī, ‘Ḥallāj’, 35; Mason, 20–21, 23).",
    "Despite these challenging circumstances, al-Ḥallāj was able to compose two of his most influential works, Kitāb al-Ṭawāsīn and Risālat al-miʿrāj during this time. He entrusted the Ṭawāsīn to Ibn ʿAṭāʾ Adamī, who visited him in prison. Later, he sent a letter to Ibn ʿAṭāʾ via Ibn Khafīf, who had also visited him, stressing the importance of keeping the Ṭawāsīn safe (see Massignon, Akhbār , 101–102; idem, La passion , 1/552–556; al-Daylamī, Sīra , 93–95; al-Shaybī, ‘Ḥallāj’, 46; for more on Ibn ʿAṭāʾ and his connection with al-Ḥallāj, see Amir-Moezzi, 63 marginal notes).",
    "During the disturbances that rocked Baghdad in 306/919, in which rioters attacked the prison where al-Ḥallāj was being held, many inmates were able to escape. Some believed the doors of the prison opening to be one of al-Ḥallāj’s miracles and said that, contrary to the wishes of his supporters, he had refused to escape (ʿAṭṭār, Tadhkira , 590; cf. al-Shaybī, ‘Ḥallāj’, 35). At around this time al-Ḥallāj’s most stubborn enemy, Ḥāmid b. al-ʿAbbās (d. 311/923), the tax-collector ( muqṭiʿ  ) of Wāsiṭ and comptroller ( mustawfī ) of the ʿAbbāsid court, known for his ambition, ruthlessness, and cunning, attained the post of chief minister.",
    "In about 308/920, Ḥāmid b. al-ʿAbbās was looking for a way to quell the protests and unrest brought about by his mismanagement of state affairs, and also to silence the objections of his enemies at court. In an attempt to assert some control over events and, no doubt, because a number of al-Ḥallāj’s sympathisers were implicated in the unrest, Ḥāmid b. al-ʿAbbās brought al-Ḥallāj to trial a second time. During his trial, al-Ḥallāj was completely cut off from any contact with other people and many of his supporters were subjected to harassment. Ḥāmid sought to bring the trial to a swift and decisive conclusion by gathering evidence in the form of witnesses to al-Ḥallāj’s statements and his own writings. One witness was a woman known as Bint al-Samarrī, who was married to al-Ḥallāj’s son, Sulaymān, and whose father was a supporter of al-Ḥallāj. In court, she was made to testify to al-Ḥallāj’s claims of divinity. According to reports of her testimony, al-Ḥallāj considered himself ‘God on earth’ (possibly a reference to Q 6:3: ‘He is God in the heavens and on the earth’) (Abū ʿAlī Miskawayh, 5/134; al-Khaṭīb, 8/134–135; Ibn al-Jawzī, Talbīs , 172; cf. al-Dhahabī, al-ʿIbar , 2/148–149, who identifies the witness as al-Samarrī’s wife; Massignon, La passion , 1/539; Zarrīnkūb, 146).",
    "In an effort to rebut the accusations against him, al-Ḥallāj insisted that he believed only in orthodox doctrines. However, when some of the more far-fetched claims came to light, including claims of divinity ( ulūhiyya ) he had written in letters to disciples and devotees, he was put in a difficult position. While acknowledging that these were his words and claims, he said that they amounted to nothing more than ʿayn al-jamʿ (‘essential union with God’), and that this was something accepted by all Sufis. At the request of Ḥāmid b. al-ʿAbbās, he wrote all his justifications and clarifications for these words, which Ḥāmid presented to some Sufis and asked them to verify them. At first the Sufis remained silent, but then some affirmed what al-Ḥallāj had said and others criticised him. Ibn ʿAṭāʾ Adamī defended al-Ḥallāj and accused Ḥāmid b. al-ʿAbbās of perfidiousness and tyranny, which led to his execution. On the other hand, the Sufi and Ẓāhirī jurist, Abū Muḥammad Ruwaym b. Aḥmad, said: ‘This person is an apostate and whoever espouses such doctrines should be put to death’, while Abū Bakr al-Shiblī adopted a more conciliatory tone, saying: ‘Whoever believes such things should be arrested’ (Miskawayh, 5/135; al-Khaṭīb, 8/127–128; al-Anṣārī, Ṭabaqāt , 383; Ibn al-Jawzī, Talbīs , 171; Ibn Kathīr, 11/148–149; also cf. al-Hujwīrī, 229, Zarrīnkūb, 146). As for the account presented by ʿAṭṭār in his Tadhkirat al-awliyāʾ (p. 585), in which al-Junayd al-Baghdādī expressed the opinion that al-Ḥallāj’s claims warranted the death penalty, al-Junayd’s death in 298/911 means that this cannot be accurate (see al-Yāfiʿī, 2/259; Shūshtarī, 2/38–39).",
    "Despite many of al-Ḥallāj’s beliefs being deemed acceptable and his denial of some of the other accusations against him, he was convicted of claiming divinity on account of his belief in ʿayn al-jamʿ , and of being a Qarmaṭī agent. Ḥāmid b. al-ʿAbbās tried to keep al-Ḥallāj apart from his supporters—especially his protectors at the court—for the next few months, and he continued to be harassed and persecuted. Eventually, al-Ḥallāj was taken to court for a third and final time, for trial under the hostile chief minister.",
    "The trial began in 309/921 and lasted for about seven months. Three judges were present for the proceedings, one Mālikī and two Ḥanafīs: Abū ʿUmar b. Yūsuf al-Ḥammādī, the Mālikī judge of the Karkh quarter of Baghdad, was given overall charge; the other two were Abū Jaʿfar b. Bahlūl, the Ḥanafī judge for the city of al-Manṣūr to the west of Baghdad; and Ibn al-Ushnānī, a Ḥanafī judge from Syria (Abū ʿAlī Miskawayh, 5/137; Ibn al-Jawzī, Talbīs , 172; Ibn al-Athīr, 8/127; al-Shaybī, al-Ṣila , 398; idem, ‘Ḥallāj’, 39; Mason, 26–27). Ḥāmid b. al-ʿAbbās thus, forestalled any interference by either Shāfiʿī or Ḥanbalī jurists who tended to oppose the ʿAbbāsid regime, especially the Shāfiʿī scholar Ibn al-Surayj, who had come to al-Ḥallāj’s defence in his first trial. In this way, the chief minister hoped to secure a definitive judgement of heresy, which would mean that al-Ḥallāj would almost certainly be put to death (Shaybī, al-Ṣila , 398). Arguably the most damning piece of evidence in this trial were the letters al-Ḥallāj had written in which he apparently claimed that the ḥ ajj pilgrimage was no longer obligatory and that local replicas of the Kaʿba could be built for pilgrims who could not afford to travel to Mecca; or others in which he said that if someone were unable to perform the ḥ ajj , they should create a prayer-niche in a clean and ritually pure part of their homes and perform all the rites of pilgrimage there, before feeding thirty orphans and giving some voluntary alms. This, he said, would suffice in place of the obligatory pilgrimage. Al-Ḥallāj was accused of citing the Kitāb al-ikhlāṣ of al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī (q.v., d. 110/728) in support of this position.",
    "The judges rejected this argument and declared the defendant to be a Qarmaṭī agent who was trying to ruin the House of God. The Mālikī judge, Abū ʿUmar al-Ḥammādī, said he could find no basis for al-Ḥallāj’s opinion in Kitāb al-ikhlāṣ . He labelled him a heretic whose ‘blood could be spilled.’ Ḥāmid reportedly seized on these words to insist that Abū ʿUmar and the other judges find al-Ḥallāj guilty and sentence him to death.",
    "Whatever the precise unfolding of events, it may well be that this accusation was a mere pretext for al-Ḥallāj’s execution. After all, there had been earlier cases of people erecting replicas of the Kaʿba, such as the Umayyad caliph ʿAbd al-Malik b. Marwān (r. 65–86/685–705), and the ʿAbbāsid al-Muʿtaṣim (r. 218–227/833–842) (see Mason, 27). There were several reasons behind the desire of Ḥāmid b. al-ʿAbbās and others to see al-Ḥallāj put to death. First, some of the more outlandish claims he had made in writing and later admitted to; second, the accusations made by former disciples who betrayed him to the authorities; third, the extreme beliefs and ideas held about him by some of his supporters; fourth, some of his mystical ideas, such as the essential union with God, his states of intoxication, and his ecstatic utterances which were incomprehensible to many people and which led others to accuse him of being a sorcerer or a trickster (see Ibn al-Athīr, 8/126–127; Zarrīnkūb, 144; Nicholson, ‘Ḥallāj’, 481). Perhaps the most important factor in seeking al-Ḥallāj’s execution was the threat he posed to the stability of the dominant political order, especially his alleged association with the Qarmaṭīs and the role his followers had played both in the violent uprisings in Baghdad and in the failed attempt to install Ibn al-Muʿizz in place of al-Muqtadir.",
    "After al-Ḥallāj’s death sentence was pronounced, Naṣr Qushūrī and Shaghab pleaded with the caliph to commute the sentence but were unsuccessful. Al-Muqtadir gave the order for the execution, which was carried out on Saturday 24 Dhū al-Qaʿda 309/24 March 922 by the city gate known as Bāb al-Ṭāq. Al-Ḥallāj was scourged a thousand times before having his hands and feet cut off. He was then hung from the gate before being decapitated. His body was then burned and the ashes were thrown into the Tigris or, according to another account, carried to the top of a minaret and scattered to the wind. His head, hands and feet were displayed on the bridge of Baghdad. A short time later, at the end of Dhū al-Qaʿda, his head was sent to his followers, who appear to have fled to Khurāsān.",
    "Some of al-Ḥallāj’s supporters appear to have held certain messianic expectations of their teacher. They anticipated his resurrection after his execution, because he had said that he would return after thirty days; some even claimed to have seen or spoken with him. Others denied that he had even died, and said that another person had been killed in his place (al-Khaṭīb, 8/141; Ibn al-Jawzī, al-Muntaẓam , 13/206; Ibn Khallikān, 2/145; Ibn Kathīr, 11/153–154; Zarrīnkūb, 143, 150; Nicholson, ‘Ḥallāj’, 481). According to Kh w ājah ʿAbd Allāh al-Anṣārī ( Ṭabaqāt , 283), al-Ḥallāj was executed because he had divulged God’s secrets and forsaken the divine law ( sharīʿa ). From his point of view, al-Ḥallāj’s death was a punishment and a sign of his deficiency, not in any way a miraculous event (see also ‘Ilāhī-nāmah’, 2/669; al-Baghdādī, 249; al-Samʿānī, Aḥmad, 417; Massignon, Akhbār , 100–101; also cf. Shūshtarī, 2/38, who says that al-Ḥallāj was put to death because he was a crypto-Shiʿi who believed in the existence of Imam al-Mahdī and was calling people to come to the aid of the imam against the ʿAbbāsid caliph). Abū Bakr al-Shiblī believed that he and al-Ḥallāj had said the same thing, but while al-Ḥallāj had been executed on account of his intellect, al-Shiblī had been spared on account of his madness (al-Samʿānī, Aḥmad, 334). Some of al-Ḥallāj’s poems and accounts of his last days suggest that he foresaw both his own death and the manner of his demise (see Anṣārī, Ṭabaqāt , 381–382).",
    "As we have seen, al-Ḥallāj had three sons and a daughter. According to Abū ʿAlī Miskawayh (5/134), one son, Sulaymān, was married to the daughter of al-Samarrī, who was one of al-Ḥallāj’s supporters and lived in Nīsābūr. Another son was called Ḥamd but was also known as Aḥmad (see al-Khaṭīb, 8/112, 134; al-Dhahabī, al-ʿIbar , 2/148, 149; Jāmī, Nafaḥāt , 158; al-Daylamī, Sīra , 107–108). Ḥamd, the youngest child, was born in either 280/893 or 281/894, and is one of the most important sources for details of his father’s fate. Ḥamd reportedly studied under his father. After the latter’s death he relocated to Khurāsān (Anṣārī, Ṭabaqāt , 386; Ibn Kathīr, 11/145; Ibn Nadīm, 269; Mason, 31; cf. ʿAṭṭār, Tadhkira , 591). According to some sources al-Ḥallāj also had a sister who claimed that she had the status of rajuliyya (spiritual virility) and that the only rajul , or true man, in Baghdad was Ḥusayn b. Manṣūr al-Ḥallāj (Najm al-Dīn, 119).",
    "Al-Ḥallāj’s most important disciples and students were ʿAbd al-Malik al-Iskāf; Ibrāhīm (or Aḥmad) b. al-Fātik, known as Ibn al-Fātik; Fāris b. ʿĪsā al-Baghdādī; Aḥmad b. Fāris; Ḥaydara; al-Samarrī; Muḥammad b. ʿAlī al-Qunnāʾī; Abū ʿAmmāra Muḥammad al-Hāshimī, known as Abū al-Mughīth al-Hāshimī, who was called ‘the prophet of Ḥallāj’; ʿUthmān b. ʿAbd Allāh b. Bishr; Aḥmad b. Ḥammād al-Mawṣilī; Abū ʿAbd Allāh Ḥusayn al-Hāshimī; and Abū al-ʿAbbās Aḥmad al-Shaṭawī al-Baghdādī who narrated a work by the title Risāla f ī al-iksīr from his master (see Abū ʿAlī Miskawayh, 5/135; al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , 308–310; al-Khaṭīb, 8/132–133, 135; al-Hujwīrī, 382; al-Anṣārī, Ṭabaqāt , 382–383; Ibn Kathīr, 11/153; Jāmī, Nafaḥāt , 154–158; Sezgin, 1/653, 4/275).",
    "According to al-Baghdādī (p. 247), some of the Sālimiyya Sufis of Baṣra (who believed the letters and sounds of the Qurʾān to be eternal) also followed al-Ḥallāj and considered his understanding of Sufi doctrines to be correct. Much later the Ḥurūfiyya also held him in high esteem and believed that the lineage of spiritual authority ( walāya ) passed down from Adam to al-Ḥallāj (see al-Shaybī, Tashayyuʿ , 220). However, the most important and influential promoter of al-Ḥallāj’s ideas was Abū al-Qāsim Naṣrābādī, who disseminated his teachings and theories in Khurāsān–and reportedly said that if there was any [true] monotheist after the prophets and the highest saints ( al-ṣiddīq ū n ), it would be al-Ḥallāj (see al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , 308; al-Khaṭīb, 8/112, 121; Ibn al-Jawzī, Talbīs , 172; Ibn Kathīr, 11/142; Massignon, La passion , 2/215–218).",
    "After al-Ḥallāj’s death, his supporters in Khūzistān followed Abū ʿAmmāra al-Dīnawarī, and those in Khurāsān followed Fāris al-Dīnawarī. Government suppression of the followers of Fāris continued until 312/924, and during that period at least three of his followers, named Ḥaydar, Shaʿrānī, and Ibn Manṣūr, were arrested and sentenced to death when they refused to denounce al-Ḥallāj (see Massignon, La passion , 1/135, 2/208–212; al-Shaybī, ‘Ḥallāj’, 43).",
    "While al-Ḥallāj was still alive, some of his followers formed a group known as the ‘Ḥallājiyya’ which survived after his death. According to al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī (8/112, 241), this group continued until the 5th/11th century and propounded incarnation and union with God, while also holding extreme beliefs about al-Ḥallāj. The Imāmī theologian and jurist al-Shaykh al-Mufīd criticised the Ḥallājiyya for their belief in incarnation and their antinomianism, saying they were more ‘astray’ than the dualists and Trinitarians, meaning the Zoroastrians and the Christians (pp. 134–135). He is said to have written a refutation of Ḥallāj’s supporters entitled al-Radd ʿalā aṣḥāb al-Ḥallāj (see al-Najāshī, 314).",
    "According to Massignon, after the death of al-Ḥallāj, one of his disciples by the name of Abū ʿAmmāra Muḥammad al-Hāshimī announced that he was a prophet receiving inspiration from the Holy Spirit and that this Spirit had first incarnated in the form of al-Ḥallāj and now, after his death, was in one of his sons who lived in hiding.  It seems that Abū ʿAmmāra believed that the spirit of the Prophet Muḥammad had been incarnated in al-Ḥallāj, the spirit of ʿĀʾisha in his wife, and the spirit of Abū Bakr in his father in-law. Sources also suggest that members of the Ḥallājiyya in Baṣra held secret meetings and were influential in bringing the Būyid dynasty to power in Iraq. However, in later centuries no mention of them remains. Some believe that these were a sect of heretics in Baghdad who believed in incarnation and union with God and said that they alone were the true followers of al-Ḥallāj; it appears likely that they did not understand his teaching and wished only to derive spiritual prestige from association with his name and his martyrdom (Massignon, Passion , 135–136; al-Hujwīrī, 232; ʿAṭṭār, Tadhkira , 584).",
    "WORKS",
    "According to the sources mentioned above, al-Ḥallāj composed anything between fifty and a thousand written works (al-Hujwīrī, 231; Rūzbihān Baqlī, Sharḥ , 455). In any case it seems certain that he was a prolific author, and the size of the following that he accumulated in different regions shows that he must have been not only a visionary but an able communicator, in writing as well as verbally. However, it seems certain that the only work of his to have survived in complete form is his Kitāb al-Ṭawāsīn . After his execution, copyists and scribes were forbidden to buy or sell his writings, and many were destroyed (see Miskawayh, 5/139; al-Shaybī, ‘Ḥallāj’, 43). Furthermore, according to ʿAbd Allāh al-Anṣārī ( Ṭabaqāt , 385), many incoherent and dubious statements have been attributed to him, as well as a large number of unknown works. In any case, the Fihrist of Ibn al-Nadīm (pp. 271–272) and some other sources record as many as fifty works under his name, of which the following eight survive.",
    "1. Bustān al-maʿrifa min kalām qudwat al-muḥaqqiqīn Manṣūr al-Ḥallāj : A collection of his sayings. It has been published together with his other works in Kitāb al-Ḥallāj: al-aʿmāl al-kāmila (‘Collected Works’), edited by Qāsim Muḥammad ʿAbbās (Beirut, 2002).",
    "2. Tafsīr Ḥusayn b. Manṣūr al-Ḥallāj : This was originally a collection of sayings on topics of Qurʾānic exegesis which were included in the Ḥaqāʾiq al-tafsīr of Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Sulamī (d. 412/1021). Massignon extracted them and, having compared them with several manuscripts and the tafsīr ʿArāʾis al-bayān fī ḥaqāʾiq al-Qurʾān by the great Persian mystic Rūzbihān Baqlī, published them in 1922 in his Essai sur les origines du lexique technique de la mystique musulmane . This Tafsīr was reprinted with a Persian introduction by Naṣr Allāh Pūrjawādī in the Majmūʿa āthār of Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Sulamī (1/235–292) (Tehran 1369 Sh./1990) and in Qāsim Muḥammad ʿAbbās’s collection.",
    "Massignon held that this commentary reveals the profound influence of the Tafsīr attributed to Imam Jaʿfar al-Ṣādiq. For example, there are many similarities in terminology, such as the use of the word mashīʾa ’ instead of irāda to denote the will of God, maḥabba instead of ‘ ʿishq ’ for love, and the use of azaliyya (pre-eternity), ḥulūl (incarnation), and the divine name, al-Ḥaqq (q.v.), to refer to God. Moreover, its structure, its Qurʾānic explanation of God’s names, and interpretations such as that of the name Nūr (light) to mean ‘the illuminating’ ( munawwar ), of Ṣamad (Eternally Self-Subsistent) as ‘depended upon’ ( maṣmūd ilayh ), and of the invocation ‘guide us’ ( ihdinā ) as ‘lead us to Your love’ ( irshadnā ilā maḥabbatik ), are all found also in this exegesis. Al-Ḥallāj also appears to have been influenced by this work in his representation of the twelve stages (in the form of the signs of the zodiac) traversed by the soul (Massignon, Essai , 181, 201–213; Pūrjawādī, 237; Nwiya, 150). Some of al-Ḥallāj’s gnostic doctrines, such as the in the pre-eternal questioning of mankind (‘Am I not your Lord?’ They said: ‘Yes indeed! We testify’, Q 7:172) the questioner and the questioned are one, and also his theory that the knowledge of all things in the Qurʾān, and the essence of the Qurʾān itself, can be found in the disconnected letters ( al-ḥurūf al-muqaṭṭaʿa , q.v . ḥurūf ) at the beginning of some chapters, can also be traced to this work (for the mystical aspects of this commentary, see Nwiya, 3, 6, 150).",
    "3. Dīwān : This is a compilation of his Arabic poetry, which appears to have been a source of interest to gnostics as early as the 4th/10th and 5th/11th centuries. It is impossible to be certain that all the verses attributed to al-Ḥallāj are of his own composition. Louis Massignon, who devoted immense efforts to tracing the textual transmission of al-Ḥallāj’s works, was doubtful about some of them. Cases of plagiarism and misattribution are common where Arabic and Persian poems are concerned, and indeed there is a group of Persian poems, very implausibly attributed to al-Ḥallāj, which goes by the title Dīwān-i Manṣūr Ḥallāj ; it may be the work of a later author, Ḥusayn Kh w ārazmī (Ernst, 24–28). According to the testimony of al-Qushayrī, there was a copy of al-Ḥallāj’s Dīwān in the personal library of Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Sulamī which ʿAlī al-Daqqāq asked his disciple, al-Qushayrī himself to take from it (al-Qushayrī, p. 236; Ernst, pp. 1–3). Several manuscripts of this work survive.",
    "The Dīwān was first published by Massignon, accompanied by a French translation, in 1931 in the Journal Asiatique , and then again in 1955 in Paris. It was also published in 1953 and 1955 in Istanbul (Sezgin, 1/653), and by Qāsim Muḥammad ʿAbbās in the Aʿmāl kāmila . In addition, many verses of al-Ḥallāj’s poetry can be found scattered among later biographical and mystical works (see Massignon, Akhbār , 113 et passim; al-Daylamī, Sīra , 101, 236–340; al-Khaṭīb, 8/115–118, 129–131; Ibn al-Jawzī, al-Muntaẓam , 13/204, 206; Ibn Khallikān, 2/141, 143–144, 146). Rūmī also includes some of al-Ḥallāj’s best-known verses in his Mathnawī (see vol. 1, verses 3934–3935, vol. 3, verse 3839). Some of al-Ḥallāj’s poetry has been translated into English by A. J. Arberry (see pp. 28–30, 106). More recently, Carl W. Ernst has published translations of many of the poems ascribed to al-Ḥallāj together with a brief but highly original and perceptive introductory study. Ernst has demonstrated not only the high quality of these verses but also their importance in the development and history of Sufi poetry in Arabic. Al-Ḥallāj’s poems will be discussed further below, with examples.",
    "4. Risāla fī al-iksīr : This work is narrated by his student, Abū al-ʿAbbās Aḥmad b. Ḥasan al-Shaṭṭawī al-Baghdādī. A manuscript is held at the Süleymaniye Library in Istanbul, and another at the University of Istanbul Library (Sezgin, 1/653, also 4/275).",
    "5. Risāla fī al- ṣ anʿa : Only the Persian translation of this work survives, the unique manuscript of which is preserved in the Ahmet III Library at the Topkapı Palace Museum, Istanbul (MS no. 2,075 (8)).",
    "6. al-Ṣayhūr fī naqḍ al-dayhūr : This work appears under a variety of names, including al-Ṣayhūr fī naqd al-dayhūr and al-Ṣayhūr fī naqṣ al-duhūr (see al-Qushayrī, 237; al-Shaybī, ‘Ḥallāj’, 43; Sezgin, 1/653). According to Krachkovsky, a manuscript of this work is preserved in the Firkovich Collection of Oriental Manuscripts in St Petersburg (MS no. 4,885) (see  Sezgin, 1/653).",
    "7. al-Ṭawāsīn . This, al-Ḥallāj’s most important work, was composed in rhymed Arabic prose and contains eleven (in some manuscripts ten) short sections, which begin with the letters Ṭāʾ sīn , and contain different discussions and topics, including walāya (sanctity, sainthood, initiatic power). The Ṭawāsīn contains a wide range of material which its author claims to have received in traversing the spiritual path. Arguably the most significant chapters of this work are the ‘Ṭāsīn al-Sirāj’, concerning the Prophet Muḥammad, and ‘Ṭāsīn al-Azal wa al-iltibās’, which is a defense of Iblīs, the Devil. The refusal of Iblīs to bow down before Adam is presented by Ḥallāj as the result of Iblīs’s inability to worship anything other than God; in this way Iblīs appears as a true, uncompromising monotheist ( muwaḥḥid ).",
    "The style and form of the Ṭawāsīn is very opaque and complex, and it is extremely difficult for anyone to understand without a prior familiarity with gnostic ideas and the language of the author. It was translated into Persian by Rūzbihān Baqlī, who also wrote a Persian commentary on mystical utterances of the Sufis (including more than one hundred attributed to al-Ḥallāj) under the title Sharḥ-i shaṭḥiyyāt . Massignon published the work on the basis of this translation and commentary, based on MS 1271 in the Murat Molla Library in Istanbul, comparing it with British Library (London) MS Add. 9692 (see Sezgin, 1/653). Massignon believed that two sections of the Ṭawāsīn were inspired by the Tafsīr ascribed to Jaʿfar al-Ṣādiq: one in which the recitation of the Qurʾān by the awliyāʾ (‘friends of God, saints) is compared to a tree, and the other explaining the Prophet’s Night Journey, especially the meaning of the fact that the Prophet turned neither right nor left on this journey (see Essai , 201–202; see also his introduction to the Tafsīr , 10).",
    "In Kitāb al-Ṭawāsīn one frequently comes across expressions that appear easy to understand, intermingled with others that are enigmatic. According to an anecdote cited by Rūzbihān Baqlī ( Sharḥ , p. 380), the Sufi master al-Shiblī reminisced that the first time he heard al-Ḥallāj speak, what the latter said was incomprehensible (‘ fahm nakardam, zīrā fahm dar ān jāʾiz nabūd’ ). One thing he recalled afterwards was al-Ḥallāj telling him, ‘Shiblī, the “secret” ( sirr ) in the parlance of this group ( ṭāʾifa) [presumably the Sufis] ‘is that of which the outward [sense] is hidden, while to them its inner meanings are explanations ( bayān ).’",
    "Two brief illustrative passages from the Ṭawāsīn must suffice here: one, which is relatively comprehensible, about the Prophet and his light, and one, more opaque, about Iblīs, the Devil. The first chapter of the book (see al-Ḥallāj, al-Aʿmāl al-kāmila , ed. ʿAbbās, pp. 161–165), entitled ‘The Ṭāsīn of the Lamp ( Sirāj )’, centres on the mystical concept of 'the Muḥammadan Light’.",
    "‘…the Lights of Prophethood emerged from his Light, [the Prophets’] light became manifest from his Light; and there is no light, out of all lights, which is more luminous, or more manifest, or is prior to time’s beginning, than the Light of the Master of Nobility ( Ṣāḥib al-Karam ). His spiritual aspiration preceded all others, his existence preceded [humanity’s] non-being, and his name preceded [the creation of] the Pen [of divine decrees]; for he was before [all human] nations were. Neither upon nor beyond the horizons, nor this side of them, was there any [created entity] more exquisite, more noble, more lofty, more just, more kindly, more fearful [of God], or more sensitive than the incumbent of this role. He is the master of mankind, the one named Aḥmad. His nature is most singular ( awḥad ), his destiny most sure ( awkad ), his essence most impassioned ( awjad ), his character most majestic ( amjad ), his aspiration most unique ( afrad ).’",
    "A second extract, from the Ṭāsīn of pre-eternity and ambiguity ( al-azal wa al-iltibās ) (see al-Aʿmāl al-kāmila , pp. 189–199), exemplifies both the more opaque mode of al-Ḥallāj’s discourse and his representation of Iblīs in al-Ṭawāsīn –a subject to which we shall return.",
    "‘…There was no unitarian in the heavens or on the earth like Iblīs. When his essential nature changed, he gave up looking around in his [spiritual] way, and he worshipped the Adored One in a state of complete detachment ( tajrīd ); but he was cursed at the moment of his affirmation of divine unicity ( tafrīd ), and was sent for when he sought increase. [God] told him, “Prostrate [before Adam].” He said, “To no other [than You will I prostrate].” [God] said, “My curse is upon you.” He replied, “To no other;",
    "My refusal is a means to extol You / my reason is bedazzled by You.",
    "And what is Adam, compared to You? / Who is Iblīs, who stands in between?",
    "I have no way to reach any but You, / and I am merely a lowly lover.”",
    "Said [God], “[No,] you have become arrogant!” [Iblīs] replied, “Had I had [even] a single moment together with You, arrogance and haughtiness would have befitting for me. It is I who knew you before time began. ‘I am better than him’ (see Qurʾān 7:12) because I was prior in [Your] service. There is no one in either realm of existence with more knowledge of You than I have. I have a will in regard to You, and You have a will in regard to me. What you willed for me pre-empted my prostrating anyone but You. If I did not prostrate, I would be returned to my origin. You created me of fire, and fire returns to fire. The decree and the choice [in the entire matter] are Yours.”",
    "8. Waṣiyya : There is a manuscript of this in the Kılıç Ali Paşa collection, Süleymaniye Library, Istanbul (MS no. 625(4), see Sezgin, 1/653).",
    "As well as the aforementioned works, many beautiful supplications by al-Ḥallāj have been preserved in the works of other authors (e.g. see Massignon, Akhbār , 24, 68–69; al-Anṣārī, Ṭabaqāt , 385). Qāsim Muḥammad ʿAbbās includes a selection of these in the Aʿmāl kāmila as well as two collections of his aphorisms entitled ‘Nuṣūṣ al-walāya’ and ‘al-Marwiyyāt’.",
    "Although the poetical works of al-Ḥallāj have long been available in printed form, only recently have they been subjected to serious study in the context of the development of Arabic poetry in the early centuries of Islam. This has come about largely thanks to the researches of Carl Ernst, whose introduction to his translations of selected poems show him to have cast ample new light on the subject. Kāmil Muṣṭafā al-Shaybī has also produced important research on al-Ḥallāj and his works. Observing that it is not always easy (or even possible) to distinguish verse by Sufis from that of other poets, Ernst marshals and interprets the poems themselves and a variety of other sources to demonstrate the significance and influence of the Ḥallājian corpus on the course of Arabic poetry, as well as the use of that medium to express mystical ideas and doctrines and evoke corresponding spiritual states. In the first centuries of the Abbasid period, poetry by Sufis was largely indistinguishable at first sight from secular verses. Not only did they employ the same verse forms, metres and rhyme schemes; they also drew on the established genres of ‘udhiyyāt (celebrating chaste love), zuhdiyyāt (moral uprightness and asceticism), and khamriyyāt (wine-drinking). According to Ernst, ‘it is impossible to separate Sufi poetry from the other kinds of literary production that flourished in the early Abbasid era’ ( Hallaj , 19). The Ḥallājian verses found in the Dīwān and the Akhbār al-Ḥallāj are important in the historical context of Arabic Sufi poetry in that they show real mastery of the difficult art of expressing theological and theopathic content in poetic form with precision and power–and also with concision, the majority of the poems being brief ones in the form known as qiṭ‘a or muqaṭṭa‘a , meaning ‘fragment’.",
    "The tenor and the power of the Ḥallāj poems will perhaps be evident (though inevitably to a limited degree only) in the translated pieces of verse below, which also provide some indication of their thematic variety–and which, even if not assuredly all by al-Ḥallāj himself, are entirely in keeping with what we know of his thought and his work. The first of these examples speaks of the twofold nature of the human being: mortal body and immortal soul:",
    "Body like a temple, luminous of heart,",
    "spirit that’s eternal, devout, wise,",
    "he returns to the spirit with its lords,",
    "but the temple remains rotting in the dust.",
    "‘Temple and Light’ (tr. Ernst: Hallaj , p. 113)",
    "In a longer piece, the spiritual seeker is exhorted to be strong and courageous and to persist during the times of difficulty that may beset him or her:",
    "When the steeds of separation descend on you",
    "And despair calls for the end of hope,",
    "Seize with your left the shield of humility",
    "And grab with the right the sword of weeping.",
    "By your soul, your soul, beware,",
    "And be alert to the betraying ambush.",
    "If loneliness comes at you in the dark,",
    "then travel with the lamps of pure light.",
    "Say to your lover, “Do you see my lowliness?",
    "Be generous, forgive me before our meeting!”",
    "In the name of love, don’t turn away",
    "From your beloved, except when desire is requited.",
    "‘The Steeds of Separation’ (tr. Ernst, Hallaj , p. 134)",
    "The experience of extreme closeness to God, to the point of seeming identity, characteristic of the personality of al-Ḥallāj is naturally a recurrent theme in his verses:",
    "How I marvel at You, and also at me!",
    "You are the very thing that I wished for.",
    "You brought me so near, so close to You,",
    "That I then believed that You were me.",
    "I was lost in an ecstatic state, until",
    "By Your Self You effaced me from myself.",
    "While I live, my only blessing is You,",
    "And after my burial You are my peace.",
    "No bosom companion have I but You,",
    "Whether You be fearsome or safety for me.",
    "The gardens of Your mystical meanings",
    "Contain every form of beauty there is.",
    "And if there is anything that I wish for,",
    "Then You are everything I could wish for.",
    "(tr. Waley; cf. ‘I wonder at You and me’: Ernst, Hallaj , p. 86)",
    "THEOLOGY AND BELIEFS",
    "The available evidence does not allow us to arrive at a conclusive and comprehensive picture of al-Ḥallāj’s theological outlook, and the school of thought to which he belonged is still widely debated. Sources characterise him as claiming to be an imam, a prophet, or even divine. It has been said he was a Ḥanafī Sunni, or possibly a Zaydī, Ismaili (Qarmaṭī), or even a Twelver Shiʿi. Some critics claim that he was influenced by the religious milieu of the Indian subcontinent, learning magic and illusionist tricks there. It has also been suggested that his statements betray Manichean influences; allegedly the Muʿtazila and other theologians of Baghdad sometimes associated him with figures such as Abū al-ʿAtāhiya (q.v.) and Ibn Abī al-ʿAwjāʾ, who were accused of promoting a Manichean-like dualistic worldview of light and darkness.",
    "Al-Ḥallāj's connections to the Zanj uprising and the Zaydī state in Ṭabaristān, too, may have influenced his political outlook (see al-Baghdādī, 248; al-Khaṭīb, 8/120–121; al-Dhahabī, Siyar , 14/318–319; idem, al-ʿIbar , 2/144; Ibn Kathīr, 11/142; see also Bīrūnī, Taḥqīq , 43–44; idem, Āthār , 258; Shūshtarī, 2/38; al-Shaybī, al-Ṣila , 397, 404–405; idem, ‘Ḥallāj’, 25–26; Iqbāl Āshtiyānī, 111–116; Zarrīnkūb, 136–141, 147). However, accounts of his life offer no indications that he had any links with the Qarmaṭīs; and the accusation that he was an agent of theirs is probably just an example of the way in which the ʿAbbāsid regime discredited its opponents. Although al-Ḥallāj was connected to sympathisers with the Zanj uprising through his wife’s family, sources make no mention of him participating in the uprising or otherwise associating with the Zanj. It also appears that accusations that he was practising magic or sleight of hand were either slanders or the result of misunderstandings.",
    "Whenever his beliefs were scrutinised at trials, al-Ḥallāj would identify himself as an orthodox Sunni Muslim who believed in all the fundamentals of the faith. However, on one occasion, when asked what his religion was, he replied that it was ‘the divine faith’ ( al-dīn al-ilāhī ) (see ʿAyn al-Quḍāt, 22; Jāmī, ‘Ashiʿʿat al-Lamaʿāt’, 102). According to ʿAyn al-Quḍāt al-Hamadānī (q.v.) (p. 22), this meant a religion dedicated in its entirety to God, or in the words of Jāmī, the very path that al-Ḥallāj was following. Some of his teachings, related in Akhbār al-Ḥallāj (p. 37), show that he saw God as utterly transcendent ( munazzah ). Accordingly, he held that to believe divinity could be combined with humanity, or humanity with divinity, constituted disbelief, because God the Creator is utterly distinct in His essence and His attributes from those of His creatures. In his view there could be no similarity between the eternal and the temporal; and therefore, to believe that God is in, above, or bound to a particular place, or to conceive of God in one’s heart or imagination, or to conceive of Him as being categorised in terms of a particular attribute, constitutes polytheism ( shirk ).",
    "A few scholars take seriously the allegations that al-Ḥallāj was a crypto-Shiʿi (see al-Shaybī, al-Ṣila , 396 et passim; Zarrīnkūb, 137). Al-Ḥallāj’s association with a number of Shiʿi notables, as well as his theological and gnostic views, have led some later Shiʿi scholars to hold him in high regard and to ascribe some form of Shiʿism to him. On the other hand, his alleged claim to be the representative or ‘gate’ of the Mahdī, and also the open hostility he encountered from some Shiʿi leaders, suggest otherwise. The theologian al-Shaykh al-Mufīd wrote a treatise entitled al-Radd ʿalā aṣḥāb al-Ḥallāj , or ‘Refutation of the Ḥallājians’ (al-Najāshī, 314; Āqā Buzurg, 10/185). As has already been mentioned, at the end of the 3rd/9th century al-Ḥallāj met the Shiʿi Abū al-Ḥasan Muḥammad b. Ḥasan al-ʿAlawī in Kūfa and lodged in his home for a while. Moreover, one of al-Ḥallāj’s main supporters during this period was Abū ʿAmmāra Muḥammad b. ʿAbd Allāh al-Hāshimī, a notable from Ahwāz who had Shiʿi inclinations (Shaybī, al-Ṣila , 396; idem, ‘Ḥallāj’, 26).",
    "Al-Ḥallāj also had links with Abū Sahl Ismāʿīl b. ʿAlī al-Nawbakhtī (d. 311/923), a Shiʿi theologian and man of letters, and Ḥusayn b. Rūḥ al-Nawbakhtī (d. 326/938), the third representative of the Twelfth Imam during the Minor Occultation, in Baghdad. He also met Abū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī b. Ḥusayn b. Bābawayh, a Shiʿi traditionist and the father of Shaykh al-Ṣadūq. Al-Shaybī (p. 27) interprets this meeting as an attempt by al-Ḥallāj to coordinate activities to subvert the authority of the ʿAbbāsid regime among scholars there. This move, however, was unsuccessful and instead elicited criticism and condemnation (Ibn Nadīm, 269; Shūshtarī, 2/38; Zarrīnkūb, 137).",
    "Some have even gone so far as to suggest that al-Ḥallāj was put to death at the instigation of Shiʿi leaders (Mashāyikh, 84–85; Iqbāl Āshtiyānī, 113) on account of his claims to be the representative of the Hidden Imam (see al-Khaṭīb, 8/120 et passim; Ibn al-Jawzī, al-Muntaẓam , 13/204; al-Shaybī, ‘Ḥallāj’, 26–27). It has also been stated that one of the tawqīʿāt (edicts) of the Hidden Imam during the Minor Occultation, which was addressed to and issued from Ḥusayn b. Rūḥ al-Nawbakhtī as the latter’s representative, dealt with the condemnation and refutation of false claimants to the post of representative, which could be read as a reference to al-Ḥallāj (see al-Ṭūsī, 409–411; al-Ṭabarsī, 2/289–290). However, this edict specifically names the false claimants to the position of representative, and al-Ḥallāj is not one of them (cf. Shūshtarī, 2/38). Therefore, such accusations against al-Ḥallāj primarily related to the prevailing conditions within Shiʿism at that point in history and should not be given any credence.",
    "From about the 7th/13th century onwards, a number of prominent Shiʿis with gnostic inclinations, such as Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī (d. 672/1274), Qāḍī Nūr Allāh Shūshtarī, Muḥammad ʿAlī Muʾadhdhin Khurāsānī, Mullā Ṣadrā (d. 1050/1640), and Qāḍī Saʿīd Qummī (d. 1107/1696), either explicitly or implicitly defended al-Ḥallāj, adopted his ideas, and wrote commentaries on his famous dictum: Anā al-Ḥaqq (‘I am the Truth!’) as well as some of his spiritual poems (Thubūt, 67 et passim).",
    "Some of al-Ḥallāj’s followers are also noted as holding beliefs very similar to those of the Twelver branch of Shiʿi Islam. For example, according to al-Maqdisī (writing ca. 355/966) in al-Badaʾ wa al-taʾrīkh , the Ḥallājiyya believed that the imams were created from the light of God (see also al-Shaybī, al-Ṣila , 397–398). The writings of al-Bīrūnī indicate that the Ḥallājiyya survived until his time, because he describes them as believing in the Mahdī and that he would appear in Tāliqān ( Āthār , 258).",
    "In a discussion with a follower of the Muʿtazilī theologian Abū ʿAlī al-Jubbāʾī, al-Ḥallāj is said to have adopted doctrines similar to those of the Ashʿarīs (q.v.), such as that of human ‘acquisition’ ( kasb ) of actions, saying: ‘Just as God created bodies without need for a cause, He also creates their attributes without a cause. Therefore, just as a servant does not truly possess himself, neither does he truly possess his own actions’ (Massignon, Akhbār , 117; al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , 313; al-Dhahabī, al-ʿIbar , 2/146).",
    "MYSTICAL IDEAS AND TEACHINGS",
    "Al-Ḥallāj’s ideas about mysticism can be discovered from his behaviour, his sayings, and his written works. To his admirers and to his imitators on the spiritual path, al-Ḥallāj is the personification of a transcendant spiritual love whose sole object of devotion is the Eternal Beloved (see ʿAṭṭār, Manṭiq , 236; Najm al-Dīn, 336–337). For this reason, al-Ḥallāj appeared in many of the texts of the Islamic mystical tradition as a symbol of pure unadulterated love, one so powerful that he was willing to sacrifice his life for it. In addition to this, he considered his own words and statements to be direct inspirations from God that even the greatest saints could not grasp (al-Anṣārī, Ṭabaqāt , 385). However, despite the powerfully emotive aspect of his teachings, and the complexity of his language, it is still possible to discern his most important theories and ideas.",
    "On the subject of divine unity ( tawḥīd ), al-Ḥallāj was most concerned with its epistemological aspects. One of his best-known definitions of divine unity is: ‘Distinguishing eternity from temporality’ ( ifrād al-qidam ʿan al-ḥadath ), which involves turning away from the temporal towards the eternal. However, he saw this as the most elementary understanding of divine unity; true tawḥīd meant to lose oneself in the eternal. To him is attributed the saying that the ultimate reality of divine unity was accessible only to the Prophet of Islam (Massignon, Akhbār , 81, 94–95; al-Anṣārī, Ṭabaqāt , 384). Al-Ḥallāj asserted that anyone who had grasped the true meaning of tawḥīd would cease to ask ‘why’ ( limā ) or ‘how’ ( kayf ) (al-Qushayrī, 47). Divine unity was to be realised intuitively rather than discursively, because to affirm God’s entails affirming one’s own existence, and whoever affirms their own existence has associated a partner with God. It is God who proclaims His absolute oneness upon the tongues of His own creatures (Massignon, Akhbār , 93).",
    "According to al-Ḥallāj, the highest level of divine unity is ‘the unity of veracity’ ( tawḥīd al-ṣidq ), for which he claimed God had singled out him alone (see al-Sarrāj, 345–346; al-Daylamī, Sīra , 240; al-Anṣārī, Ṭabaqāt , 381). As long as the spiritual wayfarer does not reach the stations of divine unity, he remains on the level of the sharīʿa . But when he reaches these stations, the wayfarer rises above the plane of the sharīʿa and becomes solely occupied by the lights rising out of the depths of veracity ( Akhbār , 73; Nwiya, 314). However, the notion of transcending the sharīʿa is clearly contrary to the tenets of normative Islam and of Sufism as taught, for example, by Junayd and his school.",
    "Al-Ḥallāj asserted that God’s essential attributes were eternal and belonged solely to Him, while the remainder of His attributes were also identical with His essence. He said that the Truth’s, or the Real’s, relation to His own self is completely unitary, and that nothing other than Him could be spoken of, until He created bodies, forms, lives, knowledge and sight, and He spoke to the realms of sovereignty ( al-mulk ) and dominion ( al-malakūt ), and there came to be an agent ( fāʿil ), an object of the action ( mafʿūl ), and an action ( fiʿl ). In pre-eternal time, God watched Himself and there was nothing else. All of the attributes assigned to God, whether knowledge, power, love, affection, wisdom, greatness, beauty, majesty, mercy, sanctity, kindness etc. are nothing but forms within His essence and are identical with His essence (see al-Daylamī, ʿAṭf , 52–53; al-Qushayrī, 42).",
    "Al-Ḥallāj considered the divine names in terms of ontology and epistemology, both as being names comprehensible to human beings, and as realities in relation to the divine essence. He believed that in terms of human understanding of the divine, the divine names were purely formal entities ( rasm ), meaning nothing other than a name ( ism ) and a veil ( ḥijāb , q.v. ḥijāb in Sufism), while they were seen by al-Ḥallāj as being identical with the divine essence. Al-Ḥallāj also posited a vertical relationship between the names pertaining to knowledge, power and reality. He distinguished between ẓāhir and bāṭin –that is, between the outwardly apparent aspect of the divine names and their inner, hidden reality (al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , 308–309; Ibn Mulaqqin, 187; for more on al-Ḥallāj’s sayings regarding tawḥīd , see ʿAbbās, 227).",
    "Al-Ḥallāj strongly emphasised knowledge ( maʿrifa ) of God. One of his most famous maxims in this regard is: ‘sufficient for the ecstatic is the realisation of the One’s unicity’ ( ḥasb al-wājid ifrād al-wāḥid ) ( Akhbār , 36; al-Daylamī, Sīra , 236; see also, ʿAṭṭār, Tadhkira , 593; cf. ʿAyn al-Quḍāt, 295). If we understand wajd (ecstasy, q.v.) as knowledge (it can also mean ‘finding’), then the ecstatic is the knower, and apprehending the utter oneness of God is true knowledge and being, the perfect union of which is the goal of the spiritual path. Even though al-Ḥallāj considered the perfection of this knowledge impossible (see al-Ḥallāj, ‘Bustān’, 213; idem, ‘al-Dīwān’, 303), he still stressed the importance of pursuing it. For example, in his advice to his son he said that an atom of knowledge of God is better than all the worship of the jinn and mankind (al-Anṣārī, Ṭabaqāt , 386). In al-Ḥallāj’s thought, knowledge of God is the inner reality of the sharīʿa . Therefore, whoever attains the outward reality of the sharīʿa , the inner reality of which is knowledge of God, will also attain this latter knowledge ( Akhbār , 19).",
    "According to al-Ḥallāj, knowledge of the divine is only realised when the wayfarer sees nothing else; anyone who sees or even conceives of other than God cannot claim to have known Him in His absolute oneness. It is divine unity that establishes the singularity of all individual entities. Al-Ḥallāj asserts that there is a connection between prophetic revelation and knowledge of the divine, which he classes as a kind of continuous and ongoing revelation; attaining true knowledge is also a source of protection for the wayfarer. For him, a true conception of reality is one which cannot be opposed or contradicted (al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , 311; al-Qushayrī, 314; al-Anṣārī, Ṭabaqāt , 385; al-ʿAbbādī, 67; ʿAṭṭār, Tadhkira , 588). When the mystic reaches this level, he can also attain the station of al-walāya al-takwīniyya (‘creative authority’) by means of which the mystic is empowered to produce phenomena by uttering the formula bismillāh ; this being the reflection of the divine power to create through the utterance of God, kun , ‘Be!’ In other words, just as things come into being through God’s saying ‘Be!’, the mystic can bring things forth by uttering the basmala , the formula ‘In the Name of God’ (al-Ḥallāj, ‘Tafsīr’, 109; Ibn al-ʿArabī, 3/187; see also Nwiya, 325). On the subject of knowledge, it is noteworthy that he considers proof (q.v. burhān ) to be something that emanates from the heart and which the soul is incapable of denying (ʿIzz al-Dīn, 105; Ernst, 64–65).",
    "Al-Ḥallāj believed that the ultimate goal of all acts of worship and obedience is to reach the divine. It is through the fragrances ( rawāʾiḥ ) of obeying God that the spiritual wayfarer becomes endowed with the divine attributes, and it is through becoming united with God that he finds peace (al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , 311). When God wishes to bestow His walāya on one of His servants, He first opens the door of remembrance ( dhikr ) to the servant and then the door of proximity ( qurb ). Then He seats the servant upon the chair of divine unity ( tawḥīd ) and lifts the veils from his eyes so that he may behold Him. Then God admits the servant to the abode of solitude ( fardāniyya ), and draws back the cloak of greatness and majesty. When the servant catches sight of God’s majesty, the seeker loses himself in annihilation and subsists in the divine (q.v. fanāʾ and baqāʾ ); he comes under the protection and watchfulness of the divine and is freed from the demands of the ego (see ʿAyn al-Quḍāt, 247).",
    "According to al-Ḥallāj, whoever is intoxicated by the lights of divine unity ( anwār al-tawḥīd ) is unable to express God’s transcendence and instead utters the realities of His oneness as a drunkard divulges secrets (al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , 312–313; cf. al-Anṣārī, Ṭabaqāt , 385). Rūzbihān Baqlī relates the following verse from al-Ḥallāj, on the intoxication of God’s oneness:",
    "subḥāna man aẓhara nāsūtahu / sirra sanā lāhūtihi al-thāqibi",
    "thumma bada fī khalqihi ẓāhiran / fī ṣ ūrat al-ākil wa al-shāribi",
    "Glory be to Him Who has displayed His human nature,",
    "the secret of His brilliant Godhead’s splendour!",
    "Then He appeared manifest in His creation,",
    "In the form of [a human] who eats and who drinks.’",
    "( ʿAbhar , 148; cf. al-Daylamī, Sīra , 101; al-Khaṭīb, 8/129).",
    "Like many Sufi masters, al-Ḥallāj believed the highest level of spiritual wayfaring to be the station of servanthood ( maqām al-ʿubūdiyya ), which is that of the Prophets and those of perfected sincerity ( ṣ iddīq ū n ). At this level the wayfarer finds freedom, and all suffering and fatigue normally associated with servanthood leaves him. No hardship—not even those associated with the performance of legal obligations—enters the heart of the servant (al-Qushayrī, 220). Al-Sulamī relates that al-Ḥallāj said that the embarrassment ( ḥayā ) of the awliyāʾ before their Lord removes from their hearts the joy of doing anything worthy of thanks ( surūr minna ), while the embarrassment of obedience removes from their hearts the joy of obedience ( surūr al- ṭ āʿa ) (al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , 311–312). The Sufi points from God, while everyone else points towards God (Khargūshī, 15). True disciples are freed from the bonds of both worlds, and from the moment they resolve to undertake the spiritual quest, set out towards the divine and do not stop until they reach Him (al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , 310; al-Anṣārī, Ṭabaqāt , 385).",
    "According to al-Ḥallāj, one who seeks the divine using the light of faith is like one seeking the Sun by the light of the stars (al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , 313; Kh w ājah, Ṭabaqāt , 385; see also Ernst, 63). He also said that one who has not become detached from his own humanity will never be able to commune with the divine (al-Anṣārī, Ṭabaqāt , 385). Equally, if anyone fears anything other than God or places his hopes in anything other than God, all doors will be closed to him and he will be covered by seventy veils, the lowest of which is the veil of doubt, and he will be overcome by anxiety and distress. However, this fear will not be the praiseworthy fear of God, but merely his fear for the outcome of his affairs and the changing of his circumstances (al-Qushayrī, 129).",
    "The most famous, and notorious, of al-Ḥallāj’s mystical ideas was that of ‘essential union’ ( ʿayn al-jamʿ  ) as expressed by his theopathic utterance: ‘ Anā al-Ḥaqq ’, ‘I am the Truth (or the Real)’!. This statement is forever associated with al-Ḥallāj (see Akhbār , 108) and it was on this basis that the more exoterically-minded jurists and theologians accused him of believing in incarnation and union with God (Ibn Kathīr, 11/142; cf. Ibn Khallikān, 2/140, who erroneously attributes to al-Ḥallāj the famous dictum of Bāyazīd Basṭāmī (q.v.) ‘Within this cloak of mine there is nothing but God!’).",
    "According to ʿAyn al-Quḍāt al-Hamadānī, these were the words of the wayfarer’s Creator, not of the wayfarer himself (p. 62), while Sanāʾī refers to this as ‘the ultimate secret’ ( rāz-i muṭlaq ) (p. 113; cf. Sarrāj, 231). Nicholson argued that the statement ‘I am the Real’ was not merely ‘an ejaculation of visionary enthusiasm’, but rather ‘the intuitive formula in which a whole system of mythology summed itself up.’ In other words, this utterance perfectly encapsulates the gnostic’s worldview and theology ( The Idea , 38).",
    "ʿAṭṭār explains the misunderstanding of al-Ḥallāj’s utterance as stemming from the exotericists’ lack of understanding of Sufi language ( Manṭiq , 127–128), while Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī (pp. 89–90), and others who followed him, said that it was the result of al-Ḥallāj’s annihilation ( fanāʾ  ) in God, and that when one is overcome by such a state, one’s words and deeds are not one’s own. For al-Ṭūsī and his followers, these words express the mystic’s annihilation in God, negation of selfhood, and affirmation of the subsistence and selfhood of God, rather than a claim to be divine. Therefore, when al-Ḥallāj uttered: ‘I am the Real!’ this was in response to his own supplication: ‘Between me and You, my ego intervenes / so by Your grace remove my ego from in between.’ This is because whoever witnesses the light of the Real will see nothing other than Him; the perceiver, the perceived, and perception lose all distinction and become one (see ʿAṭṭār, Tadhkira , 588–589; Thubūt, 68–69; cf. al-Samʿānī, Aḥmad, 132).",
    "According to al-Ḥallāj, the Prophet Muḥammad was the manifestation of the perfect human, and the only person ever to whom the reality of divine unity ( ḥaqīqat al-tawḥīd ) had been revealed ( Akhbār , 88, 94–95). In his commentary on the verse ‘And truly you are vast in character’ ( wa innaka la-ʿalā khuluqin ʿaẓīm , Q 68:4), he says: ‘Your character is vast because you were not satisfied with the morals of created beings ( akhlāq al-makhlūqāt ), but rather advanced through the divine attributes until you reached the divine essence. There, through the divine essence you died to your own essence and thereby attained the reality of the divine essence ( ḥaqīqat al-dhāt )’ (Massignon, Essai , 408; see also Nwiya, 76).",
    "Al-Ḥallāj also propounded that the light of the Prophet Muḥammad is eternal and that the light of all the other prophets was derived from it. In the Ṭ āsīn of the Lantern ( al-Sirāj ) and elsewhere, he says that the light of prophecy and the lights of the prophets were made manifest by the light of the Prophet Muḥammad. His light is the most brilliant, dazzling and beautiful of all lights (al-Ḥallāj, Ṭawāsīn , 161–162, 163, 168, 176; cf. Nicholson, The Idea , 41–42). Elsewhere, al-Ḥallāj compares the station of the Prophet to that of Iblīs, saying that ‘the reality of chivalry ( futuwwa ) belongs to none but Aḥmad [i.e. Muḥammad] and Iblīs’ (ʿAyn al-Quḍāt, 284). According to Ṣadr al-Dīn Shīrāzī ( Mafātīḥ , 376), by this al-Ḥallāj meant that each of these loci of manifestation is perfect and unique in and of itself: One is the perfect manifestation of the names of love ( asmāʾ al-maḥabba ), while the other is a manifestation of the names of coercive power ( asmāʾ al-qahr ). In addition to this, he divided people into two groups: prophets and non-prophets, and said that prophets are in control of their ecstatic states, but those who are not prophets are controlled and directed by their states (al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , 311).",
    "Al-Ḥallāj is considered the first Islamic thinker to break with conventional theology and defend Iblīs’s rebellion against God. In his al-Ṭawāsīn he contends that Iblīs could not reconcile bowing to Adam with being a servant to the eternal divine decree. Unable to bring himself to overstep (as he saw it) the bounds of God’s infinite wisdom, power and knowledge, he had no choice but to refuse the command to bow to Adam. He could read his fate in a clear record ( kitāb mubīn ) and he knew what would become of him, but he saw his free-will and choice as coming from God, not from himself. Therefore, he said: ‘All choice, including mine, belongs to You. It is You who chose for me. If there is anything that prevents me from bowing to him, it is You… and if You had truly willed that I bow to him, I would have obeyed! (al-Ḥallāj, al-Ṭawāsīn , 189–190).",
    "In fact, al-Ḥallāj–to the outrage of many–considered Iblīs to be the paragon of monotheism and a true and devoted lover who saw and knew nothing besides his Beloved. Accordingly, he is superior to and more knowledgeable than all; and, although he has been driven away from the divine presence, he still holds fast to this love. Iblīs’s service is still purer, and his remembrance of God brighter, because previously he had served his beloved and deity for himself, whereas now he serves God only for God. Iblīs even considers his arrogance and pride to be justified, saying: ‘If I spent but a moment with Him, I would be justified in my pride and arrogance. But I have been in God’s presence since eternity!’ Iblīs was warned of Hellfire, but he would not relent. He was told: ‘Prostrate!’ but said: ‘To no other.’ He was told: ‘Upon you shall be My curse until the Day of Resurrection’, but said again: ‘For no other.’ Then he said ‘Even if You punish me for all eternity, I will prostrate to no one but God’ (see al-Ḥallāj, al-Ṭawāsīn , 190–192; ‘Tafsīr’, 109–110; q.v. 2/601–602; Nicholson, The Idea , 42–45).",
    "Although al-Ḥallāj praised Iblīs’s nobility, chivalry and monotheism, he condemned him for refusing to obey a divine command. As has already been mentioned, al-Ḥallāj drew an explicit comparison between Iblīs and the Prophet Muḥammad in the chapter Azal wa al-iltibās in his Ṭawāsīn . According to Rūzbihān Baqlī, Iblīs was the leader of the angels as the Prophet is the leader of humanity. ‘Just as the Prophet is the keeper of God’s pre-eternal grace ( lu ṭ fiyya azaliyya ), Iblīs is the keeper of His everlasting power ( qahriyya abadiyya ). The Prophet was created from the lights of kindness, while Iblīs was created from the flame of power. That which is subtle ( laṭīf ) is the source of kindnesses ( luṭfiyyāt ), while that which is turbid ( kathīf  ) is the source of torments ( qahriyyāt )…He misguides whom He wills and He guides whom He wills’ ( Sharḥ , 508–510).",
    "Al-Ḥallāj believed love to be one of the attributes of the divine Essence, and likened it to a flame. It is the light of the first flame, burning eternally, coloured with every conceivable colour and endowed with every conceivable attribute. God’s Essence flares within itself, and His attributes glow within themselves. Its source is He-ness ( huwiyya ) and it is free from Self-ness ( inniyya ); it is manifestly hidden, its essence is the reality of existence, and its attributes reflect complete perfection (al-Ḥallāj, ‘al-Dīwān’, 288; see also al-Daylamī, ʿAṭf , 90–91; ʿAbbās, 244). Al-Ḥallāj believed love to be an extreme longing in a person’s heart, caused by the majesty and beauty ( jalāl wa jamāl ) of God overwhelming them, intensified by witnessing the existence of the Beloved, until nothing except the Beloved remained. If this is according to God’s will ( mashiyya ), then it is for Him, from Him, with Him, to Him, by Him, in Him, upon Him, Him alone, and Him. Therefore, it is He who longs for those who seek Him (al-Ḥallāj, ‘Tafsīr’, 112; al-Daylamī, ʿAṭf , 131).",
    "AL-ḤALLĀJ AS VIEWED BY SUFIS",
    "The complex nature of al-Ḥallāj’s personality and his eccentric—and sometimes contradictory—behaviour not only provoked the anger of non-Sufis but also gave rise to concerns amongst many leading gnostics of his day. According to al-Hujwīrī (q.v., d. late 5th/11th century), only a handful of these Sufi masters, including Abū al-ʿAbbās b. ʿAṭāʾ Adamī (d. 309/921), Abū al-Qāsim Naṣrābādī (q.v.) (d. 367/977), and Ibn Khafīf of Shīrāz (d. 371/981), took a wholly positive view of al-Ḥallāj and were prepared to defend him openly.",
    "Of these, Ibn ʿAṭāʾ Adamī lost his life defending al-Ḥallāj (Ibn Kathīr, 11/144; al-Baghdādī, 248–250; al-Khaṭīb, 8/112; ʿAṭṭār, Tadhkira , 583; see also Jāmī, Nafaḥāt , 143–144; see also Nicholson, ‘Ḥallāj’, 481); Naṣrābādī was an important promoter of al-Ḥallāj’s teachings and doctrines in Khurāsān. He also made copies of his works, which may explain why he preached and taught in secret (al-Hujwīrī, 229). After meeting al-Ḥallāj in prison, Ibn Khafīf, described him as a celestial scholar with a pleasant countenance, an awe-inspiring presence, and steadfast character: ‘If what I saw from him was not monotheism ( tawḥīd ), then who in this world is a monotheist?’ (see al-Daylamī, Sīra , 93–97, 100–101; al-Sulamī, Ṭabaqāt , 308, 485; Ibn Bākūya, 32–33, 38; Anṣārī, Ṭabaqāt , 380; Jāmī, Nafaḥāt , 153).",
    "Other Sufis, such as al-Junayd al-Baghdādī (d. 297/910), Abū Bakr al-Shiblī (d. 334/945), Abū Muḥammad Aḥmad al-Jurayrī (d. 311/924), ʿAlī b. Ibrāhīm al-Ḥuṣrī (q.v., d. 371/982), ʿAbd al-Karīm al-Qushayrī (d. 521/1127) and even Kh w ājah ʿAbd Allāh al-Anṣārī Harawī (q.v., d. 481/1089) chose to remain silent and withhold judgement on his case (al-Hujwīrī, 229–230; cf. Massignon, Akhbār , 338). Anṣārī is reported to have said that he knew al-Ḥallāj’s utterances only incompletely and therefore, preferred to refrain from judging him ( Ṭabaqāt , 380, see also 383; ‘Ilāhī-nāmah’, 2/662).",
    "However there were several Sufis, including ʿAmr b. ʿUthmān al-Makkī, Abū Yaʿqūb al-Nahrjūrī, Abū Yaʿqūb al-Aqṭaʿ, and ʿAlī b. Sahl al-Iṣfahānī, who publicly condemned al-Ḥallāj, and some, such as Ibrāhīm b. Shaybān and Abū Bakr al-Ṣūlī, who accused him of believing in incarnation and unification [with God] (q.v. ḥulūl wa ittiḥād ), as well as being a heretic, a Qarmaṭī, and a trickster (see Massignon, Akhbār , 338; Ibn al-Nadīm, 269–270; al-Khaṭīb, 8/112, 118–121, 129; al-Hujwīrī, 229–230; Ibn al-Jawzī, al-Muntaẓam , 13/202–203; ʿAṭṭār, Tadhkira , 584–585; Ibn al-Athīr, 8/126–127; Ibn Khallikān, 2/140–141; al-Dhahabī, Siyar , 14/314, 317–318; Ibn Kathīr, 11/144, 149; Jāmī, Nafaḥāt , 153). Some of his critics devoted portions of their own works to exposing what they considered to be his trickery. According to ʿAbd al-Qāhir al-Baghdādī (p. 247), these included Qāḍī Abū Bakr Muḥammad b. Ṭayyib al-Ashʿarī whose work about the inability of the Muʿtazila to verify the evidence of prophethood ascribed a variety of magic tricks and sleights of hand to al-Ḥallāj (for other cases, see al-Khaṭīb, 8/122–127; Ibn Kathīr, 11/144 et passim).",
    "LATER VIEWS ON AL-ḤALLĀJ",
    "Despite the different ways in which he was perceived and received during his own lifetime, over the succeeding centuries many great Sufis extolled his sanctity and considered him as one of the true lovers of God. These included Abū Naṣr al-Sarrāj (d. 378/988), Abū Saʿīd b. Abī al-Khayr (q.v., d. 440/1049), Abū al-Qāsim Kurragānī (q.v. d. ca. 469/1076), Abū al-ʿAbbās Aḥmad b. Muḥammad Shaqqānī, Abū ʿAlī al-Fārmadī (q.v. d. 477/1084), Abū Yaʿqūb Yūsuf al-Hamadānī (q.v. d. 535/1141), and Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī (d. 672/1273) (al-Hujwīrī, 229–230; Muḥammad b. Munawwar, 1/72; ʿAṭṭār, Tadhkira , 583; Aflākī, 1/285; Jāmī, Nafaḥāt , 153). He was nevertheless an ambivalent figure. In his Persian treatise Kashf al-maḥjūb , ʿAlī Hujwīrī (q.v.) has some praise for al-Ḥallāj; but he also devotes a section of chapter 14 of that work, concerning schools of Sufism and their tenets, to the school of his ostensible followers (Ḥallājiyān), decrying and classifying them among the invalid ones to be avoided. According to al-Yāfiʿī (2/253), mystics such as Abū Ḥāmid al-Ghazālī, ʿAbd al-Qādir al-Jīlānī and Shihāb al-Dīn Suhrawardī sought to validate and al-Ḥallāj’s spiritual states. At the same time, such Sufi masters upheld the opinion that if taken literally, his utterances contravene the letter of the law (in Islam, such questions fall within the scope of sacred law). In any case, to have done otherwise could well have led to their own orthodoxy being impugned. Not long after them, by contrast, the famous Persian mystic Rūzbihān Baqlī of Shiraz (d. 605/1209) composed profound commentaries on the shatḥiyyāt of al-Ḥallāj and other Sufis, in both Arabic and Persian versions, exalting their author as one of the greatest of saints and gnostics.",
    "Among the classical Persian poets, it is Farīd al-Dīn ‘Aṭṭār who is foremost in acclaiming Ḥusayn b. Manṣūr al-Ḥallāj as one of the greatest Sufis. Apart from the allusions to him in his poems– mathnawī s as well as ghazals–there is also the entry on al-Ḥallāj which constitutes a climactic passage in his biographical compilation of saints, Tadhkirat al-awliyā . Besides describing in vivid detail the physical torment which the execution (or martyrdom) of al-Ḥallāj involved, ‘Aṭṭār describes al-Junayd as having taken of his Sufi garb and donned that of a jurist before pronouncing him guilty according to sacred law. In reality, however, al-Junayd died ten years before al-Ḥallāj did. For ‘Aṭṭār, as for a number of later Persian poets of the same persuasion, al-Ḥallāj is the very paragon of self-sacrifice for the love of God. In his ghazals and in the Mathnawī , Jalāl al-Dīn quotes some phrases from his verses.",
    "Admiration of ‘Manṣūr-i Ḥallāj’, as he is commonly referred to by such authors (‘Manṣūr meaning ‘granted victory’) as a martyr to divine love is often coupled with an acknowledgement that in saying ‘I am the Truth (or ‘I am God’), he was at fault in speaking openly of a spiritual secret that should never be publicly divulged because of the danger of its being misunderstood by the uninitiated. Thus, the renowned Persian mystical lyric poet Shams al-Dīn Ḥāfiẓ Shīrāzī (q.v.) states in one of his ghazals: ‘That great one by whom the gallows were ennobled, / His fault was this: that he divulged secrets.’",
    "In the Arab world, in modern times, the figure of al-Ḥallāj has appeared in literary works, and even in the visual arts, as a symbol of fearless individualism and defiance of political authorities (Ernst, 33–34)."
