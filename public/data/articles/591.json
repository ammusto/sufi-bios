    "EBRĀHĪM B. ADHAM b. Manṣūr b. Yazīd b. Jāber ʿEjlī (d. 166/777-78), prominent Sufi and ascetic of 2nd/8th century. Ebrāhīm was born to a notable Kufan family in Balḵ, migrated with his tribe from Khorasan to Syria before 137/754, and was killed in a military expedition against Byzantium in about 160-66/777-83. In Sufi legends various glamorous tales are attributed to Ebrāhīm’s repentance and abdication from the governorship of Balḵ and his conversion to asceticism (e.g., Abū Noʿaym, VII. pp. 367-95; VIII, pp. 3-58; Ebn Asāker, II, pp. 167-96). In Persian Mystic literature further exalted legendary anecdotes and mystical miraculous deeds were attributed to Ebrahīm. Aṭṭār  portrayed the most embellished image of Ebrāhīm in his Taḏkerat al-awlīāʾ (I, pp. 85-106).",
