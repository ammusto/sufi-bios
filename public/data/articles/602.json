    "Abū Saʿīd b. Abī l-Khayr (357–440/967–1049) stands as a pivotal figure in the history of Persian Ṣūfīsm. His descendants did not succeed in maintaining the saint's legacy in the form of a congregation ( ṭarīqa , lit. “way”) that subsequently survived and flourished, yet Abū Saʿīd shaped the aesthetic, institutions, and ethos of Persian Ṣūfīsm through seminal practices, such as khānqāh (“convent”) life, samāʿ (“spiritual concert”) sessions, and poetry. While later sources, such as Zakarīyā Qazvīnī (d. 682/1283), who in Āthār al-bilād (“Monuments of the countries”) (Beirut 1960, 361–2) attributed the very founding of the khānqāh institution to Abū Saʿīd, are mistaken, these attributions are nevertheless a good indication of how Abū Saʿīd came to be viewed as a paradigmatic figure. Abū Saʿīd is thus part of the important transition in Ṣūfīsm, which eventually led to the rise of Ṣūfī orders in the seventh/thirteenth century.",
    "Abū Saʿīd did not compose his own writings, but he stands out among contemporary Ṣūfīs in having two separate hagiographies devoted exclusively to him. The first of these, Ḥālāt va Sukhanān-i Abū Saʿīd (“The spiritual states and discourses of Abū Saʿīd”), was composed by Muḥammad b. Abī Rawḥ (d. 541/1147), a great-great-grandson of the famous saint. A cousin of this author, Muḥammad b. al-Munawwar, utilised the above-mentioned work in composing the second hagiography, Asrār al-tawḥīd (“Secrets of God's oneness”) around 574/1178. The Asrār is widely considered a masterpiece of Persian literature and a crucial source both for Ṣūfīsm and the social history of Iran in the sixth/twelfth century.",
    "We know more about Abū Saʿīd than we know about most other premodern Ṣūfīs, largely through Asrār al-tawḥīd . He was born in Mayhana, once a large town in mediaeval Khurāsān, subsequently destroyed during Ghuzz attacks in the sixth/twelfth century. He studied the Qurʾān with Abū Muḥammad ʿAnnāzī, and mastered Arabic grammar. Abū Saʿīd then went to Merv and studied under Abū ʿAbdallāh Khiḍrī (d. c. 373/983), a great scholar of fiqh (jurisprudence), who taught jurisprudence from the perspective of all four Sunnī schools. He followed that with the study of Shāfiʿī fiqh (the jurisprudence of the Sunnī school of religious law derived from the teachings of Abū ʿAbdallāh al-Shāfiʿī, d. 204/820) under Abū Bakr al-Qaffāl (d. 417/1026). Abū Saʿīd was thus part of the illustrious group of fifth/eleventh-century Shāfiʿī Ṣūfīs. According to his biography, he studied tafsīr (Qurʾānic commentary), fiqh , and ḥadīth (“Traditions” of the prophet Muḥammad) with Abū ʿAlī Zāhir b. Aḥmad al-Faqīh (d. 389/999) in Sarakhs (Khurāsān).",
    "Abū Saʿīd's own involvement with Ṣūfīsm began at a young age, through his father. He became acquainted with the mystical poet Abū l-Qāsim Bishr Yāsīn (d. 380/990). It was in Sarakhs that he met his spiritual mentor, the fourth/tenth-century Ṣūfī Abū l-Faḍl Ḥasan Sarakhsī, and it was under Abū l-Faḍl's instruction that Abū Saʿīd mastered the Ṣūfī practice of dhikr (“remembering” of God by the ritualised repetition of his names or of formulas). A colourful account in Asrār mentions Abū Saʿīd as repeating the dhikr , “Allāh, Allāh” for seven years. Whenever he would become distracted, the fiery image of a black man would appear before him to restore his concentration. Abū Saʿīd remained close to Abū l-Faḍl until (and even after) the latter's death, often returning to him for instruction and deepening his spiritual practice. During this phase of his life, Abū Saʿīd undertook severe ascetic practices, frequently in the desert. For his part, Abū l-Faḍl seems to have endeavoured to balance Abū Saʿīd's ascetic practices with service to humanity, particularly to his (Abū Saʿīd's) mother, a common trope in Ṣūfī vitae.",
    "One of the intriguing ascetic practices of Abū Saʿīd was hanging upside-down (maʿkūs) while reciting the Qurʾān in a secluded ribāṭ (a remote fortified building). Following Abū l-Faḍl Sarakhsī's death, Abū Saʿīd may have studied with another famous fourth/tenth-century Ṣūfī, Abū l-ʿAbbās al-Qaṣṣāb. He subsequently returned to Mayhana, where he established his khānqāh .",
    "Abū Saʿīd also began spending more time in Nīshāpūr, which was a more important city than Mayhana under the Great Saljūqs (fifth/eleventh to sixth/twelfth century). His legacy is intricately connected with the Saljūqs, and he is depicted in Asrār as having interactions with many Saljūq notables, such as Abū Jaʿfar Bāzargān Nīshāpūrī and Abū ʿUmarū Ḥaskū, who were leaders of Nīshāpūr's merchants. Some narratives claim that Abū Saʿīd designated Saljūq leaders Chaghrī (d. 452/1060) and Ṭughril (d. 455/1063), the two grandsons of the eponym of the dynasty, for future glory through his firāsat (“clairvoyance”), and that he was even responsible for authorising them to rule over Khurāsān (Chaghrī) and al-ʿIrāq (Ṭughril) ( Asrār , 1:156). But the Saljūq figure who is most frequently connected to Abū Saʿīd is the famed vizier Niẓām al-Mulk (d. 485/1092), best remembered for his long treatise on kingship, Siyar al-mulūk (“The manners of kings”). Its narratives begin with an incident from Niẓām al-Mulk's childhood in which Abū Saʿīd pointed out in a crowd the young boy who would some day become vizier and identified him as the future “master of the whole world” ( Asrār , 1:58–59). Other narratives in Asrār have Niẓām al-Mulk recalling, “Whatever I have attained has been through Abū Saʿīd. It is for this reason that I am the ghulām (“servant”) of all the Ṣūfīs in the world” ( Asrār , 1:90). He thus justifies patronising all Abū Saʿīd's followers. These narratives balance the past designation and legitimisation offered by Abū Saʿīd with the present devotion and patronage of the vizier.",
    "Many of the accounts in Asrār detail tensions between Abū Saʿīd and other famous members of the religious elite of Nīshāpūr, including Ashʿarīs, such as Abū Muḥammad Juwaynī (d. 438/1046, the father of Imām al-Ḥaramayn), Ṣūfīs, such as al-Qushayrī (d. 465/1072), Karrāmī leaders such as Abū Bakr Muḥammad b. Isḥāq, and Ḥanbalīs, such as Khwāja ʿAbdallāh Anṣārī (d. 481/1089). Even some Ṣūfīs took exception to Abū Saʿīd's emphasis on the practice of samāʿ . In addition, he was accused of violating the rules of samāʿ by admitting young men into public ceremonies. In contrast to his earlier ascetic practices, Abū Saʿīd was criticised at this phase of his life for his lavish lifestyle (which allegedly included, for example, reclining on silk cushions) and being lax in his prayers. In contrast to some austere preachers, Abū Saʿīd preferred not to cite those Qurʾānic verses that focus on torment and punishment, focusing instead on those dealing with God's mercy and compassion ( Asrār , 1:200–1).",
    "Many have speculated on the possibility of Abū Saʿīd having met the great philosopher Ibn Sīnā (Avicenna, d. 428/1037). This encounter is based on Ibn Sīnā's purported statement about the shaykh , “Everything I know, he sees,” and Abū Saʿīd's acknowledgment of the philosopher, “Everything I see, he knows.” ( Asrār , 1:194–5) Asrār preserves this encounter, which may well be apocryphal, to argue for the compatibility yet distinctness of Ṣūfīsm (taṣawwuf) and philosophy (falsafa) . Fritz Meier concludes by stating that while Ibn Sīnā and Abū Saʿīd may or may not have met in Nīshāpūr, it is possible that they corresponded (cf. editor's introduction to Asrār , 1:xliii–lvi).",
    "A major theme of Abū Saʿīd's teachings in Asrār al-tawḥīd is that of the efficacy of the samāʿ ceremony, featuring music, poetry (mainly Persian poetry, although not his own), crying out, and rending clothes. An oft-recited story recalls Abū Saʿīd's interaction with Muḥammad al-Qāyinī during a samāʿ session. Abū Saʿīd went into an ecstatic state and the whole group became enraptured. The muezzin gave the call to prayer, and al-Qāyinī said, “Prayers, prayers!” Abū Saʿīd replied, “We are at prayers!” and continued with the samāʿ . Al-Qāyinī left to perform the prayers. When Abū Saʿīd emerged from ecstasy, he stated that al-Qāyinī, while virtuous, lacked understanding of the Ṣūfī path. ( Asrār , 1:226). This emphasis on samāʿ and occasional antinomianism both attracted people to Abū Saʿīd and exposed him to critique from more orthoprax critics.",
    "Abū Saʿīd also emphasised service to the spiritual community. Part of his legacy was the full articulation of Ṣūfīsm as a social form of piety, a theme that he did not invent but rather refined. One of the areas in which Abū Saʿīd's legacy is particularly detectable is in the later Central Asian Naqshbandī tradition, which also emphasised active involvement in social affairs and the well-being of humanity. It is quite probable that the later Naqshbandī tradition adopted these socially engaged teachings from Abū Saʿīd.",
    "Abū Saʿīd's teachings on khidmat-i darvīshān (“service to the poor”) went beyond simply providing material goods for the needy and also included soothing their hearts (rāḥatī ba dil) and comforting them. Some of his sermons ( Asrār , 1:210) include metaphors of the khānqāh overflowing with jewels for the dervishes to pick up, namely, the “jewels” of service (khidmat) . Abū Saʿīd is depicted in Asrār as personally sweeping the mosque, and even cleaning latrines used by dervishes. He also identified specific guidelines for the behavior of those staying in the khānqāh . In terms of gender roles in Persian Ṣūfīsm, it is worth noting that Abū Saʿīd initiated an ascetic woman named Īshī Nīlī, and through his wife offered the woman a khirqa (a rough cloak or coarse gown, and hence a mystic robe, a symbol of embarking on the Ṣūfī path). Īshī is subsequently described as having become the “leader of all the Ṣūfīs” in Nīshāpūr ( Asrār , 1:73–4).",
    "As is the case in many of the Ṣūfī sources of this period, there is a great deal of attention devoted to establishing spiritual lineages through the bestowing and receiving of the khirqa . Abū Saʿīd is said to have been given a khirqa by al-Sulamī (d. 412/1021), who received it from Naṣrābādī (d. 367/977), followed in turn by al-Shiblī (d. 334/945), al-Junayd (d. 298/910), Sarī al-Saqaṭī (d. c. 253/867), Maʿrūf al-Karkhī (d. 200/815), Jaʿfar al-Ṣādiq (d. 148/765), Muḥammad al-Bāqir (d. c. 114–26/732–43), Zayn al-ʿĀbidīn (94–5/712–3), Ḥusayn (d. 61/680), and ʿAlī (d. 40/661), who received it from the prophet Muḥammad himself. While some scholars have questioned whether Abū Saʿīd actually received al-Sulamī's khirqa , the more important issue here is the attempt of the Ṣūfī community to establish a silsila (chain of transmission) by linking themselves back to earlier Ṣūfīs and eventually to the prophet Muḥammad.",
    "In addition to establishing connections with earlier Ṣūfīs, Asrār also contains many anecdotes pointing to the necessity of one's personal spiritual experience. Abū Saʿīd recalls, “I do not speak from what I have heard, but from what I have learned through my own experience” ( Asrār , 1:51).",
    "Just as Abū Saʿīd's hagiographers sought to connect him to earlier figures, later Ṣūfī tradition reached back to Abū Saʿīd. The hagiography of Aḥmad-i Jām (d. 536/1141), by Ghaznavī, composed around 570/1175, attempts to establish a spiritual transmission between him and Abū Saʿīd. Meier rightly questioned the historicity of such a claim, but it can still be seen as a sign of of Abū Saʿīd's prestige throughout the following centuries.",
    "ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Jāmī (d. 898/1492), the Persian scholar, mystic, and poet often regarded as the last great mystical poet of Iran, praised Abū Saʿīd as “sultan of [his] time (waqt) , the beauty of the ṭarīqat folk, and the ennobler of hearts.” Jāmī devoted an extensive section of his Nafaḥāt al-uns (“Breaths of intimacy”) to Abū Saʿīd, and quoted from Asrār . He recounts almost verbatim one of Abū Saʿīd's famous statements in which he identifies saintly souls as belonging not to those who can walk on water or fly in the air, but rather those who “sit and rise, eat and sleep among people, conduct trade with people in the midst of the bazaar, and mix with people—and yet do not become neglectful of God for a moment in their heart” ( Asrār , 1:199; Nafaḥāt al-uns , 310). One way of gauging the importance of Abū Saʿīd in later Ṣūfī tradition is to note that Jāmī's entry on Abū Saʿīd is longer than that on almost any other Ṣūfī, far longer than those on al-Junayd, al-Qushayrī, al-Sulamī, Abū Ḥāmid al-Ghazālī (d. 505/1111), or al-Ḥallāj (d. 310/922), and rivalled only by figures such as Mawlānā Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī (d. 672/1273), Aḥmad-i Jām (d. 536–7/1141–2), and Bahāʾ al-Dīn Naqshband (d. 793/1390). Jāmī's depiction of Abū Saʿīd includes examples of poetry recited by Abū Saʿīd, “I'll hide within my own poem, so that I can kiss you when you recite it” ( Asrār , 1:267; Nafaḥāt al-uns , 309).",
    "The commemoration of Abū Saʿīd in the later textual tradition compensates for the extinction of his biological descendants. A hundred and fifteen of Abū Saʿīd's descendants were brutalised and killed during the 548/1153 Ghuzz incursions into Khurāsān ( Asrār , 1:380), and Abū Saʿīd's shrine and khānqāh were destroyed. Yet Abū Saʿīd's emphasis on samāʿ , poetry, and khānqāh life has left the imprint of his aesthetically rich and compassionate practice of Islam upon the subsequent history of Persian Ṣūfīsm.",
